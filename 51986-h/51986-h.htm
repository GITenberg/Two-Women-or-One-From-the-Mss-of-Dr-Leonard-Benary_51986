    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;THE FIRST NIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y name is Leonard
      Benary&mdash;rather a foreign-sounding name, though I am a pure-blooded
      Englishman. I reside at No. 63, Riverview Road, in the American city of
      Adironda, though I was born in Devonshire. And I am a physician and
      surgeon, though retired from active practice. My age can be computed when
      I say that I came into the world on the 21st day of July, in the year
      1818.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must at the outset crave the reader's indulgence for two things. First,
      my style. I am not a literary man; and my style will therefore be
      ungraceful. Secondly, my provincialisms. I have lived in Adironda for very
      nearly half a century, and I have therefore fallen into divers local
      peculiarities of speech. But I have a singular, and I believe an
      interesting and significant, story to tell, and I think it had better be
      ill told than not told at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It begins with the night of Friday, June 13th, 1884.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards twelve o'clock on that night I was walking in an easterly
      direction along the south side of Washington Street, between Myrtle Avenue
      and Riverview Road, on my way home from a concert which I had attended at
      the Academy of Music. Moving in the same direction, on the same side of
      the street, and leading me by something like a hundred feet, I could make
      out the figure of a woman. Except for us two, the neighbourhood appeared
      to be deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything about my fellow pedestrian, beyond her sex, which was proclaimed
      by the outline of her gown as she passed under a street-lamp&mdash;whether
      she was young or old, white or black, a lady or a beggar&mdash;I was
      unable, owing to the darkness of the night, and to the distance that
      separated us, to distinguish. Indeed, I should most likely have paid no
      attention whatever to her, for I was busy with my own thoughts, had I not
      happened to notice that when she readied the corner of Riverview Road,
      instead of turning into that thoroughfare, she proceeded to the terrace at
      the foot of Washington Street, and immediately disappeared down the stone
      staircase which leads thence to the water's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      This action at once struck me as odd, and put an end to my pre-occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could a solitary woman want at the brink of the Yellow Snake River at
      twelve o'clock midnight?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her errand could scarcely be a benign one; and the conjecture that suicide
      might possibly be its object, instantly, of course, arose in my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      My duty under the circumstances, anyhow, seemed plain&mdash;to keep an eye
      upon her, and hold myself in readiness to interfere, if needful.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment's deliberation, I, too, descended the stone stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <div style="height: 4em;">
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;AT THE RIVER SIDE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>et to keep an eye
      upon her was more easily said than done. At the bottom of the terrace it
      was impenetrably dark. Not a star shone from the clouded sky. The points
      of light along the opposite shore&mdash;and here and there, upon the bosom
      of the stream, the red or green lantern of a vessel&mdash;punctured the
      darkness without relieving it. Strain my eyesight as I might, I could see
      nothing beyond the length of my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lapping of the waves upon the strand, and about the piles of the
      little T-shaped landing-stage that extends into the river at this point,
      was distinctly audible, and served to guide me. Towards the landing-stage
      I cautiously advanced; and when I felt the planking of it beneath my feet,
      I halted. The whereabouts of the woman I had no means of determining.
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;if her business be self-destruction, she has not
      yet transacted it, for I have heard no splash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! Suddenly a flare of heat-lightning on the eastern horizon illuminated
      the land and the water. It was very brief, but it lasted long enough for
      me to take my bearings, and to discern the object of my quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing, a mass of shadow, at the very verge of the little wharf,
      distant not more than three yards in front of me. A moment later I had
      silently gained her side, stretched out my hand, and laid firm hold upon
      her by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In great and entirely natural terror, she started back: as luck would have
      it, not in the direction of the water, for else she had certainly tumbled
      in, perhaps dragging me with her. And though she uttered no articulate
      sound, she caught her breath in a sharp spasmodic gasp, and I could feel
      her tremble violently under my touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sought to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be alarmed,&rdquo; I said, speaking as gently as I could; &ldquo;I mean you no
      manner of evil. I saw you come down here from the street above; and it
      struck me as hardly a safe place for a person of your sex to visit alone
      at such an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer. A prolonged shudder swept over her, and she drew a
      deep long sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no reason to fear me,&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;I have only come to you for
      the purpose of protecting you, of being of service to you, if I can. Look&mdash;ah!
      no; it's too dark for you to see me. But I am a white-haired old man, the
      last person in the world you need be afraid of. You would not tremble and
      draw away like that, if you could know how far I am from wishing you
      anything but good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke. &ldquo;Then release my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone was haughty and indignant. She enunciated each syllable with
      frigid preciseness. From the correctness of her accent and the cultivated
      quality of her voice, I learned that I had to do with a woman of education
      and refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then release my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I dare not release your arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare not!&rdquo; echoed she, in the same indignant tone, to which now was added
      an inflection of perplexity. Sightless as the darkness rendered me, I
      could have wagered that she raised her eyebrows and curled her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not,&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly you will be good enough to explain what it is you fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly, I fear that you mean to do yourself a mischief. I dare not let
      go my hold upon you, lest you might take advantage of your liberty to
      throw yourself into the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and if I should?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a very foolish thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what concern is it of yours? What right have you to molest me? My
      life is my own, is it not, to dispose of as I please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very difficult and subtle question, involving the first
      principles of theology and ethics. I do not think we can profitably enter
      into a discussion of it just now, and here. But this much I will promise
      you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I shall not let go my hold upon your arm until I am
      persuaded that you have renounced your suicidal purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a <i>tchk</i> of exasperation. Then, after a momentary silence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are insolent and intrusive, sir. You presume upon the fact that I am
      a woman and alone, to take a shameful and unmanly advantage of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry if such is your opinion of me,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;I do only what I
      must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me you are an old man. I am not old, and I am strong. I warn you
      now to let me go. I assure you, you are unwise to trifle with me. I am a
      very desperate woman, and shall not mind consequences. If you try me
      beyond endurance&mdash;if we should come to a struggle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but we will not,&rdquo; I hastily interposed. &ldquo;You will not improve your
      superior strength against one who is moved by no other feeling than
      goodwill toward you. And besides,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;though it is true that I am
      close upon sixty-six years of age, my muscles have still some iron in
      them. I fancy I should be able to hold my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, I must acknowledge, was sheer braggadocio. I weigh but nine stone,
      measure but five feet four in my boots, and am anything rather than an
      athlete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a meddler, sir. Good or bad, your motives do not interest me. Let
      me go. My patience is exhausted. I will brook no further interference.
      Release my arm. Your conduct is an outrage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in genuine anger, stamping her foot, and tugging to escape my
      grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I do, madam, be it outrageous or otherwise, I am in common humanity
      bound to do. I should be virtually your murderer if I did less. It is my
      bounden duty to restrain you, to do what I may to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me, sir? You are in no position to help me. I have not asked your
      help. There is no help for me. You are meddlesome and officious. I will
      not dispute with you further. <i>Let me go!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke the last three words with threatening emphasis. I could hear her
      teeth come together with a decisive click after them. Again she tugged to
      break loose from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You require of me the impossible,&rdquo; was my reply. &ldquo;It is impossible for me
      to let you go. I implore you to control your anger, and to listen to me
      for one moment. You are labouring under great excitement, you are not
      accountable, you are not yourself. How can I let you go? I should never
      know another instant of peace if I stood by and suffered you to do
      yourself the injury that you contemplate. I should be a brute, a craven, a
      criminal, if I did that. I should be answerable for your death. As a human
      being, I am compelled to restrain you if I can. You must see that it is
      impossible for me to let you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you finished?&rdquo; she demanded, as I paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;for now I must ask you to let me take you to
      your home. Tomorrow morning you will feel differently, you will see all
      things by a different light. You will thank me then for what you now call
      an outrage. Think of your friends, your family. No matter what anguish you
      may be suffering, no matter to what desperate straits your affairs may be
      arrived, you have no right to attempt your life. Besides, you say you are
      young. Therefore you have the future before you; you have hope. I am older
      than you, and wiser. Be advised and guided by me. Come, let me take you to
      your home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home!&rdquo; she repeated bitterly. &ldquo;Home, friends, family! Ha-ha-ha!&rdquo; She
      laughed; but her laughter was dry and sardonic, horrid to hear. &ldquo;What you
      say would be cruel, sir, if it were not so highly humorous. You speak and
      act in ignorance. You are very far from comprehending the situation. I
      have no home. I have no family, no friends, and, worst of all, no money.
      There is not a roof in this city&mdash;no, nor in the whole world, for
      that matter&mdash;under which I can seek a welcome; not a friend,
      acquaintance, relation, not a human being, in short, to miss me, or even
      to enquire after me, if I disappear. Except, indeed, enemies; except those
      who would wish to find me for my further hurt: of them there are plenty.
      Now will you let me go? I am in extreme misery, sir. There is no help for
      me, no hope. My life is a wreck, a horror. I can't bear it, I can't endure
      it any longer. Let me go. If you understood the circumstances, you would
      not detain me. If you knew what I am, what I have done, and what I should
      have to look forward to if I lived; if you knew what it is to reach that
      pass where life means nothing for you but fire in the heart: you would not
      refuse to let me go. You could condemn me to no agony, sir, worse than to
      have to live. To live is to remember; and so long as I remember I shall be
      in torment. Even to sleep brings me no relief, for when I sleep I dream.
      Oh, for mercy's sake, let me go! Go yourself. Go away, and leave me here.
      You will not repent it. You may always recall it as an act of kindness. I
      believe you mean to be kind. Be really kind, and do not interfere with me
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had begun to speak with a recklessness and a savage irony that were
      shocking and repulsive; but in the end she spoke with a pathos and a
      passion that were irresistible. I was stirred to the bottom of my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, dear lady,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I wish you could know how deeply and
      sincerely I feel for you, how genuine and earnest my desire is to help
      you. Pray, pray give me at least a chance to do so. Look; I live in one of
      those houses, above there, on the terrace&mdash;where you see the lights.
      Come with me to my house. You say you have no roof under which you can
      seek a welcome: I will promise you a welcome there. You say you are
      friendless: let me be your friend. Come with me to my house. I believe&mdash;nay,
      I am sure&mdash;I shall be able in some way to help you. Anyhow, give me a
      chance to try. I am an old man, a physician. Come with me, and let us talk
      together. Between us we shall discover some better solution of your
      difficulties than the drastic one that you are looking to. But I will make
      a bargain with you. Come with me to my house, and remain there for one
      hour. If, at the expiration of that hour, I shall not have persuaded you
      to think better of your present purpose&mdash;if then you are still of
      your present mind&mdash;I will promise to let you depart unattended,
      without further hindrance, to go wherever and to do whatever you see fit.
      No harm can come to you from accompanying me to my house&mdash;no harm by
      any hazard, but possibly much good. Try it. Try me. Trust me. Come. Within
      an hour, if you still wish it, you may go your way alone. I give you my
      word of honour. Will you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave me no free choice, sir. It will be my only means of deliverance
      from you. I run a great risk, a great peril, greater than you can think,
      in doing so. But it is agreed that at the end of one hour I shall be my
      own mistress again? After that&mdash;hands off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the end of one hour you may go or stay, according to your own
      pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I am ready.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;WHENCE SHE CAME.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> led her into my
      back drawing-room&mdash;which apartment I use as a library and study&mdash;and
      turned up the drop-light on my writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I looked at her, and she looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had said that she was young. I was not surprised to see that she was
      beautiful as well. I do not know that I can explain just what had prepared
      me for this discovery. Perhaps, in part, her voice, which was exquisitely
      sweet and melodious. Perhaps simply the tragical and romantic
      circumstances under which I had found her. However that may be, beautiful
      she indubitably was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore no bonnet. Her hair, dark brown, curling, and abundant, was cut
      short like a boy's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her skin was fine in texture, and deathly pale. Her eyes, large, dark,
      liquid, were emotional and intelligent. Her mouth was generous in size,
      sensitive in form, and in colour perfect. But over her whole countenance
      was written legibly the signature of hard and fierce despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      From throat to foot she was wrapped in a black waterproof cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be seated,&rdquo; I began. &ldquo;Put yourself at ease in mind and body. And first of
      all, let me offer you a glass of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may spare yourself that trouble, sir,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I have no
      appetite for wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will do you good. A single glass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not drink a single drop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, a composing draught. You are my patient for the time being,
      remember. You must let me prescribe for you. You are in a state of
      excessive nervous excitement, bordering upon hysteria. Drink this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, sir, my disorder is not of the body,&rdquo; she said wearily. &ldquo;No
      medicine can relieve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I will beg of you to give this a trial. It is but a
      thimbleful. It can't hurt you, even if it should fail to benefit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For aught I know it may contain a drug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly does contain a drug. I should not offer you <i>aqua pura</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You juggle words, sir. I mean a poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come; that is good. Do you think I would have been at such pains to
      dissuade you from suicide, immediately thereafter to seek to poison you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean a deadly poison. You could do me no greater kindness than to
      offer me a deadly poison. I mean&mdash;it may contain some opiate, some
      narcotic, to deprive me of power over myself, so that I shall be unable to
      leave your house when the time is up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, look at me. Have I the appearance of a man who would attempt to
      get the better of you by an underhand trick like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you do not look deceitful,&rdquo; she answered, after a moment's scrutiny
      of my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then trust me enough to drink this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further protest she took the glass I proffered, and emptied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if you are willing, we may talk,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to talk about? I, at any rate, have nothing to say. But I
      am at your mercy for the term of one hour. You, of course, may talk as
      much as you desire. But at the end of one hour&mdash;&mdash; Please look
      at your watch. What o'clock is it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is twenty minutes after midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Five minutes have already passed. At a quarter after one I
      shall be free to leave.&rdquo; Therewith she let her head fall back upon the
      cushion of the easy-chair in which she was seated, and closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will then be free to leave, if you still wish it. But
      I doubt if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your doubt is groundless, sir. However, if it pleases you to cherish it,
      you may do so till the hour is finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot think my doubt is groundless. I told you I believed I should
      be able to show you a better way out of your troubles than the desperate
      one that you were purposing to take; and now I will make good my promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being more fully acquainted with my own affairs than you are, I assure
      you that your promise is one which cannot by any possibility be made
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time will prove or disprove the truth of that assertion. To begin with,
      may I ask you a question or two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may ask me twenty questions. I do not pledge myself to answer them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, will you answer this one? Am I right in having understood you to
      say, when we were below there, on the wharf, that you have no friends or
      kindred whose feelings you are bound to consider in determining your
      conduct, and no worldly ties or associations which you are bound to
      respect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are right in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am right in having understood you to say that; but is what you said
      true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which would imply that you suspect me of having lied,&rdquo; she returned, with
      an unlovely smile. &ldquo;Well, I don't blame you. I am a skilful and habitual
      liar, and I daresay it shows in my face. But in that case I broke my rule,
      and told the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam, I intended no such imputation. But you were agitated and
      excited; and sometimes under the stress of our excitement we unwittingly
      exaggerate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did not exaggerate. What I told you was literally true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the rest that you said? That also you re-affirm? That you are
      penniless, homeless, wretchedly unhappy, and weary of life? It seems
      brutal for me to state it thus; but I must understand clearly, for a
      purpose which you will presently see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not apologise, sir. This is no occasion for mincing matters.
      Yes, I am penniless, homeless, wretchedly unhappy, and weary of life. But
      I am worse than that. I am bad. I am utterly base and degraded. Look at
      me,&rdquo; she added, fixing her eyes boldly, even defiantly, upon mine.
      &ldquo;Examine me. I am a rare specimen. Very probably you have never seen my
      like before, and never will again. I am an example of&mdash;&rdquo; she paused
      and laughed; and there was something in her laughter that made me shudder&mdash;&ldquo;of
      total depravity,&rdquo; she concluded. Then suddenly her manner changed, and she
      became very grave. &ldquo;Would you entertain a leper in your house, sir? Yet I
      have been told that I am a moral leper. I have been told that the
      corruption-spot upon me reaches in to the core. And I think my informant
      put it very moderately. If you suspected the crimes I have been guilty of,
      the worse crimes that I have meditated, and only failed to commit because
      of material obstacles that I could not overcome, you would not harbour me
      in your house for a single minute. You would feel that my presence was a
      contamination: that I polluted the chair I sit in, the floor under my
      feet. The glass I just drank from&mdash;you would shatter it into bits,
      that no innocent man or woman might ever put lips to it again. There!
      can't you see now that I am beyond help, beyond hope? What have I to live
      for? I am an incumbrance upon the face of the earth, and hateful to myself
      into the bargain. Why keep me here an hour? Let us rescind our
      compromise.* Let me go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is possible that here and elsewhere Dr. Benary, in
     reporting conversations from memory, puts into the mouths of
     his interlocutors words and phrases from his own vocabulary,
     at the same time, without doubt, giving the substance and
     the spirit of their remarks correctly. &ldquo;Let us rescind our
     compromise,&rdquo; at any rate, falling from the lips of a woman,
     has, to say the least, an unrealistic sound.&mdash;-Editor.
</pre>
    <p>
      She rose, and stood restive, as if expecting a dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; you must stay out your hour, at all events,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;Sit
      down again. I am sure you are not so black as you paint yourself; and in
      any case, guilt confessed and repented of is more than half atoned for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not so, to begin with,&rdquo; she retorted; &ldquo;that is the shallowest,
      hollowest sort of cant. It may pass with people who know guilt only by
      hearsay, but is ridiculous to those who, like myself, have a knowledge of
      the subject at first hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guilt, crime, is atoned for only when it is undone, and all its
      consequences are obliterated. And now, speaking from my first-hand
      knowledge of the subject, I will tell you two things&mdash;first, all the
      confession and repentance in the world cannot undo a crime once done, nor
      obliterate its consequences; secondly, nothing can. You are a physician; I
      take it, therefore, you are familiar with the first principles of science:
      with what they call, I think, the Law of the Persistence of Force, the Law
      of the Conservation of Energy. If you understand that law, you will not
      dispute this simple application of it: a crime once done can never be
      undone; its consequences are ineradicable and eternal. Well and good. It
      is a puerility, in the face of the Law of the Persistence of Force, to
      talk of atonement. Atonement could come to pass only by means of a miracle&mdash;a
      suspension of Nature, and the interposition of a Supernatural Power. And
      that is where the Christians, with their dogma of vicarious atonement, are
      more rational than all the Rationalists from <i>a to zed</i>. So much for
      atonement. And now, as to repentance&mdash;who said that I repented?
      Repentance! Remorse! I will give you another piece of information, also
      speaking from firsthand knowledge. Repentance and Remorse are unmeaning
      sounds. There are no realities, no <i>things</i>, to correspond with them.
      I do not repent. No man or woman, from the beginning of time, has ever yet
      repented, in your sense of the word. We regret the losses that our crimes
      entail upon us: yes. We suffer because our crimes find us out, because
      retribution overtakes us: yes. But repent? We do not repent. Most of us
      pretend to. But I will be frank; I will not pretend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suffer because the punishment which, by my crimes, I have brought down
      upon myself, is greater than I can bear; I suffer, too, because the last
      purpose I had left to live for, which was also a criminal purpose, has
      been defeated. But I do not repent. I will not pretend to repent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be all which as it may, I will repeat what I said before: I do not
      believe that you are so black as you paint yourself. You, young,
      beautiful, intelligent&mdash;no, no. But even if you were ten times
      blacker, it would make no difference to me. For, look you, since you have
      introduced a question of science, and favoured me with a scientific
      generalisation, I will pursue the question a little further, and cap your
      generalisation with another: namely, good, bad, or indifferent, we are not
      our own creators; we do not make ourselves; we are the resultants of our
      Heredity and our Environment; and our actions, whether criminal or the
      reverse, are determined not by free-will, but by necessity. I will not
      enlarge upon that generalisation; I will leave its corollaries for your
      own imagination to perceive. But in view of it, I will say again: even if
      you were ten times blacker, it would make no difference to me. You are no
      more to blame for the colour of your soul than for the colour of your
      hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very magnanimous,&rdquo; she said bitterly, &ldquo;and your doctrine would
      sound well in a criminal court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of me as scornfully as you will,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;I am very sincerely
      anxious to befriend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is true, you have it in your power to do so with marvellous
      ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; I queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolve me from my agreement to stay here an hour. Sit still there in
      your chair, and let me go about my business unmolested and at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; to that agreement I must hold you, for your own sake. I have much to
      say to you, if you would only let me once get started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, sir!&rdquo; she cried, springing up in passion. &ldquo;You drive me to
      extremes. Do you know that you are violating the laws of the State in
      harbouring me here?&mdash;that you are exposing yourself to the risk of
      prosecution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that I should be violating the laws of humanity if I suffered you
      to lay violent hands upon yourself so long as I have it in my power to
      restrain you. As for the laws of the State, do you mean that you can bring
      an action against me for damages in interfering with your personal
      liberty? I doubt if you will do so. And I am sure no jury, apprised of the
      circumstances, would find against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still in ignorance of the situation.&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Now open your
      eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that she threw off the waterproof cloak in which she was enveloped,
      and stood before me in the blue and white striped uniform of a Deadlock
      Island convict.

      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;THE DOCTOR SPEAKS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> confess my heart
      leapt into my throat, and I gasped for breath. She, witnessing my
      stupefaction, laughed, as if in cynical enjoyment of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little: &ldquo;I think now you will permit me to bid you good evening,&rdquo;
       she said with mock ceremoniousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you have escaped from prison!&rdquo; I faltered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, from the Penitentiary across the river. You see, though we have
      never met until to-night, we have been neighbours, living within sight
      each of the other's residence, for some time. Two years already I have
      spent, somewhat monotonously, upon Deadlock Island; and, to employ
      technical language, I was 'in' for a term of which that was but an
      insignificant fraction. I had, however, certain business to transact here
      in town&mdash;a little matter to arrange with the gentleman who was the
      principal witness for the prosecution at my trial&mdash;and I seized,
      therefore, upon the first opportunity that presented itself to come hither
      incognito. But when I arrived I found that Fate, with her usual
      perversity, had put it out of my power to transact that business, the
      party of the second part having died from natural causes. Thus the one
      last only purpose I had left to live for had become impossible of
      accomplishment. And now I wish for nothing except death. At last even you
      must see the absurdity of my staying longer here in your house. Let me <i>go</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say,&rdquo; I rejoined, having by this time recovered somewhat of my
      equanimity; &ldquo;you say that you wish for nothing except death. Say what you
      will, I do not believe that you wish for death at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To that I can only answer that you deceive yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is you who deceive yourself. What you wish for is not death, but
      change&mdash;a change of condition. No truer words were ever spoken than
      those of Tennyson's:&mdash;

      What you crave under the name of death is forgetfulness. You yourself
      compressed the whole truth into five words when you said: 'To live is to
      remember.' Your inference was that to die is to forget. It is memory that
      agonizes you; it is the past which lives in memory that handicaps you,
      that hangs like a mill-stone round your neck, and goads you to despair. If
      you could forget, if you could erase the entire past from your
      consciousness, you would cease to suffer. Is not that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough, perhaps. But without pertinence. A quibble. Forgetfulness is
      what I wish for, yes. But there is no forgetfulness except in death&mdash;no
      Lethe save the Styx.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No forgetfulness <i>except</i> in death? You assume, then, that there <i>is</i>
      forgetfulness in death; a bold assumption. Have you no dread of something
      after death, the undiscovered country? Do you ignore the possibility of a
      future life? Suppose, beyond the grave, you preserve your identity&mdash;that
      is to say, your memory: in what respect will you have gained by the
      change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must take my risks. This much I know for certain: there is no
      forgetfulness in life. In death there may be. I will take my chances. Am I
      not in hell now? Any change must be a change for the better. I will take
      the risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say there is no forgetfulness in life. But suppose there were?
      Suppose it were possible for you to obtain total and permanent
      forgetfulness without dying, without taking those risks, without taking
      any risks at all? Suppose some one should come to you and say: 'See! I
      have it in my power to bestow upon you total and permanent obliviousness,
      so that the entire past, with all its events and circumstances, shall be
      perfectly effaced from your mind; so that you shall not even recall your
      name, nor your language; but, with unimpaired bodily health and mental
      capacities, shall begin life afresh, like the new-born infant, speechless,
      innocent, regenerated; another person, and yet the same:&mdash;suppose
      some one should come to you and offer that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an idle supposition! The age of miracles has passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An idle supposition? You deem it such? Let us see, let us consider. To
      begin with, answer me this: Have you never heard or read&mdash;in
      conversation, newspaper, medical report, or novel&mdash;have you never
      heard or read, I say, of a case where, through an accident, a human being
      has had befall him exactly the experience which I have just described? A
      case where a lesion of the cerebral tissues, caused perhaps by disease,
      perhaps by a concussion of the brain, or by a fracture of the skull, has
      resulted in the total annihilation of memory, without injury to the other
      intellectual faculties, so that the patient, upon recovering health and
      consciousness, could remember absolutely nothing of the past&mdash;neither
      his name, nor his nationality, nor the face of his father or mother, nor
      even how to speak, walk, eat&mdash;but was literally <i>born anew</i>, and
      had to begin life over again from the start? Surely, everybody who has
      ears has heard, everybody who can read has read, of cases of that nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I have read of such cases, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You have read of such cases. So!&mdash;Now, then, suppose an
      accident of that sort should befall <i>you?</i> Everything you can hope
      for from death would come to pass, and yet you would live. What better
      could you desire?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet <i>I</i> would live? Hardly. My body would live, true. But <i>I</i>,
      my personality, my identity, would have vanished. For is not the very pith
      and marrow of one's identity, remembrance? Is not memory the birthmark, so
      to speak, by which one recognises one's-self? Is it not the cord upon
      which one's experiences are strung, which holds them together, and
      establishes their unity? My body would live, true enough. But it would be
      inhabited and animated by another spirit, another mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, even so? It is the extinction of your identity which you seek to
      bring about by means of death. But you have no ground for supposing that
      death involves any such extinction. Atheist, agnostic, what you will, you
      must always acknowledge and allow for that possibility of a future life.
      Whereas, the man or woman to whom the accident happens which we have
      assumed, obtains for a surety that which he or she can only dubiously hope
      for from death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but there is a mighty difference. It is not within my power to cause
      such an accident. It <i>is</i> within my power to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not within your power to cause such an accident? Not within <i>your</i>
      power, I grant. But will you say that it is not within human power, not
      within any man's power? Imagine whatever human circumstance you like,
      which can come to pass by accident. Then, speaking <i>à priori</i>, tell
      me of any conclusive reason why that circumstance should not be brought to
      pass by design? Why man, investigating the causes of it, enlightened by
      his science, employing his cunning, should not be able at will to occasion
      it? Take this very case in hand&mdash;the total obliteration of a human
      being memory of the past. A blow upon the head, the result of an accident,
      can occasion it. Why not a blow upon the head, the result of man's
      deliberate purpose? Insanity, small-pox, consumption, paralysis, deafness,
      blindness&mdash;each of these it would be entirely possible for man
      voluntarily to induce. Why not oblivion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never heard of its being done. I once read a novel in which
      something of the kind was related&mdash;'Dr. Heidenhoff's Process'&mdash;but
      even in that novel, the author had not the audacity to pretend that his
      story was possible; it turned out to be a dream. But then, after all, that
      was quite a different thing. It was the obliteration not of the whole
      memory, but simply the memory of one particular fact or group of facts.
      The memory in respect of other facts remained intact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that indeed! That, of course, it may not as yet be within the power
      of science to accomplish. That, as yet, I will grant you, is only the
      material for a romancer's fancy. I cannot cause you to forget any one fact
      or train of facts, while leaving your memory unaffected regarding other
      facts. But the obliteration of the whole memory is a very different
      matter. It has happened frequently by accident. You have never heard of
      its being effected by design, though you will acknowledge the theoretical
      possibility of its being so effected. Well and good. Now the truth is
      this: not only is it theoretically possible, but it is practically
      feasible.. It can be done; and I, even I, can do it. That same
      obliviousness which, as the case-books of physicians bear abundant
      testimony, Nature often produces through the medium of disease or
      violence, I&mdash;I who speak to you&mdash;I can produce by means of a
      surgical operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is incredible,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incredible or not, it is a fact,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What a stone striking you upon
      the head may accomplish, I can accomplish with my instruments. I can cause
      a depression of one of the bones of your skull, at a certain point upon
      the tissues of the brain, so that, when you recover from the influence of
      the anaesthetic which I administer, you are returned to the mental and
      moral condition of infancy. You remember nothing. You know nothing. Your
      mind is as a blank sheet of paper. The past is abolished. The future is
      before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what you say is true, you possess a terrible power. Are surgeons
      generally able to do this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every intelligent surgeon must recognise the antecedent possibility of
      the operation. But when you ask me whether surgeons generally know how to
      perform it, I suppose that they do not. It is a discovery which I have
      made, by the examination of a large number of skulls, and the dissection
      of a large number of brains. I have never communicated it to anybody else.
      Others, for all I know, may have made the same discovery independently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why have you kept it a secret? It would have made you famous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had many reasons for keeping it a secret. You yourself have named
      one of them: it is a terrible power. I have not thought it prudent as yet
      to put it into the hands of the faculty at large; but it will be published
      after, if not before, my death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you <i>can</i> do this. <i>Have</i> you ever done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon a human being&mdash;no. Upon animals&mdash;upon dogs, monkeys, and
      horses&mdash;yes; often, and with unvarying success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Animals, indeed!&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;But never upon a human being. It is a
      descent from the sublime to the grotesque. You are anxious to obtain a
      subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not deny that I should be glad to obtain a subject, if it pleases
      you to put it in that downright way. I have never performed the operation
      upon a human being; but I can predict with absolute assurance just what
      its consequences upon a human being would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me hear your prediction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to begin with, let me tell you the circumstances of an actual case,
      which came under my observation, where the thing happened accidentally.
      The patient was a Frenchman, thirty-two years old, in robust health. I
      think, from the point of view of morals, he was the most depraved wretch
      it was ever my bad fortune to encounter. He was a brute, a sot, a liar, a
      thief&mdash;a bad lot all round. I chanced to know a good deal about him,
      because he was the husband of a servant in my family. The affair occurred
      more than thirty years ago. I say he was a depraved wretch. What does that
      mean? It means that, like every mother's son of us, he came into this
      world a bundle of potentialities, of latent spiritual potentialities,
      inherited from his million or more of ancestors, some of these
      potentialities being for good, others of them for evil; and it means that
      his environment had been such, and had so acted upon him, as to develop
      those that were for evil, and to leave dormant those that were for good.
      That wants to be borne in mind. Very well. He was the husband of a servant
      in my family, a most respectable and virtuous woman, also French, who
      would have nothing to do with him; but whom it was his pleasantest
      amusement to torment by hanging around our house, seeking to waylay her
      when she went abroad, striving to gain admittance when she was within
      doors. Late one evening we above stairs were surprised by the noise of a
      disturbance in the kitchen: a man's voice, a woman's voice, loud in
      altercation. I hurried down to learn the occasion of it. Halfway there, my
      ears were startled by the sudden short sound of a pistol-shot, followed by
      dead silence. I entered the kitchen, but arrived a moment too late. Our
      woman servant stood in the centre of the floor, holding a smoking revolver
      in her hand. Her husband lay prostrate, unconscious, perhaps dead, at her
      feet. I demanded an explanation. It appeared that he had stolen into the
      kitchen, where his wife sat alone, and, coming upon her suddenly, had
      attempted to abduct and carry her off by main force. The foolish woman
      confessed that some days before she had bought herself a pistol, with a
      view to just such an emergency as this; and now she had used it. Well, I
      examined the man, and I found, to my great relief, that he was not dead,
      and that, she being but an indifferent marks-woman, the ball had not even
      entered his body. It had struck him on the head at an oblique angle, and
      had glanced off. However, it had injured him quite seriously enough,
      having, indeed, fractured his skull at a certain point. We carried him
      upstairs, and put him to bed. For upwards of sixty hours&mdash;nearly
      three days&mdash;he lay in total unconsciousness. For six weeks he lay in
      a stupor just a hair's breadth removed from total unconsciousness; but
      by-and-by his wound had healed, and he was convalescent. Now, however,
      what was his mental condition? Precisely that of a new-born baby! His
      memory had been utterly destroyed. He had forgotten the simplest primary
      functions of life: how to speak, how to eat, how to walk, how to use his
      fingers. He could not remember his name; he could not recognise his wife.
      He had all the lessons of experience to learn anew. But you must recollect
      that, being an adult, his brain, as an organ, was full-grown, was mature.
      Therefore, he acquired knowledge with astonishing rapidity&mdash;learning
      almost as much in a fortnight as a child learns in a year. At the end of
      one month after we began his education, he could walk, feed himself, dress
      himself, and was beginning to talk. At the end of six months he spoke as
      fluently as I do&mdash;English, mind you, not French, which had been his
      mother-tongue. At the end of a year he read without difficulty, and wrote
      a good hand. What was most remarkable, however, though entirely natural,
      his moral nature had undergone a complete transformation. In a new
      environment, treated with kindness, surrounded by wholesome influences,
      'trained up in the way he should go,' and absolutely oblivious of every
      fact, event, circumstance, and association of his past, he became a new,
      another, an entirely different man. Now, of the million spiritual
      potentialities, predispositions, that heredity had implanted in him, those
      that made for good were vivified, those that made for bad left dormant. He
      was as decent and as honest a fellow as one could wish to meet, and he had
      plenty of intelligence and common sense. I kept him in my service, as a
      sort of general factotum, for more than twenty years; then he died. Before
      his death he made a will, bequeathing to me the only thing of especial
      value that he had to leave behind him. Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I unlocked a cabinet, and produced from it a skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see it,&rdquo; she said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it in her hands, without the faintest show of repugnance, and
      studied it intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like a fairy-tale. It is marvellous,&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Science abounds in marvels no less stupendous,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It was my
      observation of that man's case, and of the beneficent results of it, that
      suggested to me the possibility of bringing such things to pass of a set,
      purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For years I have made the brain and the skull a study, with that
      possibility in view. I am able to say now that I can perform the operation
      with perfect certainty of success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she went on, after a pause, &ldquo;it is scarcely inspiring to think that
      the character, the morality, of a human being, can be influenced, can be
      radically altered, by a mere physical condition like that&mdash;to think
      that the character of the soul can be changed by a change in the structure
      of the body. It is enough to establish materialism pure and simple; the
      only logical consequences of which are cynicism and pessimism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly one of the many psychological facts which go to prove
      that while it is the tenant of the body the soul must adapt itself to its
      habitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem to prove that the soul is not simply the tenant of the
      body, but its slave, its victim, its creature. As the materialists express
      it, that mind, thought, emotion, are but functions of the brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would perhaps lend colour to that hypothesis; but it does not prove
      it. Nothing can be proved relative to the human soul. Like all elemental
      things, it is in its very essence an insoluble mystery. All elemental
      things? Nay, it is <i>the</i> elemental thing, the ultimate thing, the
      only thing we know at first hand. All other things we know only as they
      are mirrored in it; we know them only by the impressions they produce upon
      our souls. Ten thousand hypotheses concerning it&mdash;concerning its
      origin, its nature, its meaning, its destiny&mdash;are equally plausible,
      equally inadequate. It cannot by seeking be found out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent now for a long while. At last, &ldquo;Will you describe your
      operation to me?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would need a medical education to follow such a description.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it anything like what they call trepanning, or trephining?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But very remotely. A partial fracture, and a depression, of the bone are
      caused; but no particle of it is removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the worst that could happen, in case of the operation
      miscarrying? What would be the chances of the subject's losing not only
      his memory, but his reason&mdash;becoming an imbecile or a maniac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no chance of that. The worst that could happen would be death.
      It is as safe an operation as any in which the knife is employed. But, of
      course, in all operations which involve the use of the knife there is some
      danger. There is always the possibility of inflammation. But that
      possibility is by no means a probability. The chances are largely against
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you are sure one of two things would happen either the operation
      would prove a success, or the patient would die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much time would have to elapse after the operation, before the
      patient would be able to take care of himself again&mdash;before he would
      have regained sufficient knowledge to act as a responsible and competent
      human being?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say a year. Perhaps more, perhaps less. But I will say a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And during that year? Suppose, for example, that I should offer myself to
      you as a subject&mdash;how should I be provided for during the period of
      my incompetence? And what education should I receive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be provided for by me. You would be lodged and taken care of
      here in this house. My sister, ten years younger than I, the kindest and
      the gentlest of women, would be your nurse, your companion, and your
      teacher. We would give you the same education that we would give a child
      of our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but you have not told me your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Benary&mdash;Leonard Benary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dr. Benary, I am willing to submit to your operation. I make no
      professions of gratitude, for&mdash;though, whether it kills me or
      regenerates me, I shall be equally your debtor&mdash;I take it you are not
      sorry to find a subject to experiment upon; and therefore it will be a
      fair exchange, and no robbery. Will you proceed with the operation here,
      now, to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me, no. You must have some sleep first. I will call my sister.
      She will show you to a room. Then, perhaps, to-morrow, after a good
      night's rest, you will be in a favourable condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your sister&mdash;what will she say to this?&rdquo; She pointed to her
      prison-garb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will wait here while I go to summon her, I can promise you a
      kindly welcome from her. I shall explain all the circumstances to her; and
      she will not mind your costume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I went upstairs to rouse my sister, Miss Josephine Benary.

      CHAPTER V.&mdash;THE DOCTOR ACTS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ext morning, at
      about eleven o'clock, my good sister Josephine came to me in my study, and
      said, &ldquo;She is awake now and wishes to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at her service,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Will she join me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is eager to have you operate. She asked me where you would do so. I
      told her I supposed there, in her bed. Then she said she would not waste
      time by getting up, and wished me to tell you that she is waiting to have
      it done. I suspect that she is partly influenced by a reluctance to put on
      her prison uniform again. I should have offered her the use of my
      wardrobe, but she is so much taller and larger than I, that that would be
      absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure, so it would. Very well. I will go to her directly. If
      she is in a favourable condition of mind and body, it will, perhaps, be as
      well not to delay. But first tell me&mdash;you have held some conversation
      with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what impression do you form of her character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very pretty. She is even beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed. &ldquo;What has that to do with her character?99
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I infer her character as much from her appearance as from her behaviour,
      as much from her physiognomy as from her speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. And your inference is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot be quite sure. There is a certain hardness in her face, a
      certain cynical listlessness in her manner, which may indicate a vice of
      character, but which may, on the other hand, result simply from hardship
      and suffering. She is undoubtedly clever. She has received a good
      education; she expresses herself well; she has a marvellously musical
      voice. Yet, on the whole, I cannot say that I find her likeable or
      agreeable. She seems to proceed upon the assumption that nobody is moved
      by any but selfish motives; that everybody has an axe to grind; and that
      she must be constantly on her guard lest we take some advantage of her.
      She is horribly suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do not know that I can say anything more. I cannot quite fathom
      her&mdash;quite make her out. It is a question in my mind whether she is
      naturally a young woman of good instincts, whose passions have betrayed
      her into the commission of some crime, or whether she is inherently and
      intrinsically corrupt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towards which alternative do you incline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like to express a final opinion; but I am afraid, from what
      little I have seen of her, I am afraid that I incline towards the latter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she is intrinsically bad. Well, it will be interesting, after our
      operation, to see whether, in a new environment, under new conditions, the
      good that is latent in her&mdash;as good is latent in every human soul&mdash;will
      be developed. And now will you come with me to her room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she not prefer to see you alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should she? Come, let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We found her sitting up in bed, waiting for us. By daylight she seemed to
      me even more beautiful than she had seemed by gaslight. Her features were
      strongly yet finely modelled; her skin was exquisitely delicate, both in
      texture and in colour; and her eyes were wonderfully liquid and
      translucent. But an expression of deep melancholy brooded over her whole
      countenance; while underlying that again, was certainly visible the
      cynical hardness that Josephine had complained of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having wished her good-morning, I proceeded at once to my business as a
      physician; ascertained her pulse and her temperature, and inquired how she
      had slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not had such a night's sleep for I know not how long,&rdquo; she
      answered. &ldquo;Heaven knows I had enough to think about to keep me awake, yet
      I must have lain in total unconsciousness for fully nine hours. What was
      most grateful, I did not dream. All which leads me to suspect that,
      despite your protestations to the contrary, the medicine you made me drink
      last evening contained an opiate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The medicine I prevailed upon you to drink last evening,&rdquo; I explained,
      &ldquo;was the mildest composing-draught known to the Pharmacopoeia&mdash;a most
      harmless mixture of orange-flower water, bromide, and sugar. If it had the
      effect of a sleeping-potion, I am very glad to learn it, for it indicates
      the degree of your nervous susceptibility&mdash;a point upon which it is
      highly desirable that I should be informed. And are you still of the same
      mind in which I left you? You have not reconsidered your determination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am still ready to be killed or regenerated&mdash;I am really quite
      indifferent which. When I awoke this morning, I could not help fancying
      that the conversation which I seemed to recall had never really taken
      place&mdash;that I had dreamed it. But this lady, your sister, assures me
      that my doubt is groundless. Now I can only request you to begin and get
      over with it as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My beginning must be in the nature of an interrogatory. I must ask you
      for certain information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My questions shall be few: only those formal ones which, as a physician,
      I should put to any patient whom I was about to treat. First, then, what
      is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Louise Massarte, spelt M-a-s-s-a-r-t-e.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened my case-book, prepared my fountain-pen for action, and wrote
      &ldquo;Louise Massarte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a foreign name, is it not?&rdquo; I inquired &ldquo;Were you born in this
      country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the other hopeful subject of whom you told me last night, I was born
      in France&mdash;at the city of Tours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Native of France,&rdquo; I wrote. Then aloud s &ldquo;Of French parents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am French by descent and by place of birth. But I have lived in
      America all my life. I was brought here when I was two years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you speak French, I take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak French and English with equal ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other language?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you, if you will forgive my asking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be six-and-twenty on the eighth of August.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are your parents living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both my father and mother are long since dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any brothers or sisters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was an only child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you married or single?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, finally, is there any fact or circumstance which you would like
      to mention and have recorded? For, you must bear in mind, you will shortly
      have forgotten everything connected with your past; and if there is
      anything you will wish to remember, you had better tell it to me now, and
      I will make a memorandum of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing that I shall wish to remember,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Nothing
      but what I shall be glad to forget. However, I fancy what you say is but a
      hint to the effect that you are curious to know my history. I have no
      objection in telling it to you. It is not an edifying history. Most women,
      I daresay, would be ashamed to tell it; but I have got beyond even
      pretending to feel ashamed of anything; and if you desire to hear it, you
      have only to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;you must not think of telling it. It would
      excite you and fatigue you; whereas it is of the highest importance for
      the success of our operation that you should be at rest in mind as well as
      in body. Besides, and irrespective of that consideration, it is better
      that neither my sister, nor I, nor indeed any living person, should hear
      it. You yourself will in a little while have forgotten it. What right has
      anybody else to remember it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, you will doubtless find the gist of it in the morning paper. It
      will in all likelihood be printed with an account of my escape from the
      Penitentiary,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At which insinuation my sister Josephine cried out, &ldquo;You little know my
      brother. There is indeed something about your escape in the morning paper;
      but the instant he discovered the headlines of the article, he said, 'This
      is something, Josephine, that neither you nor I must read.' And he threw
      the paper into the fireplace, and applied a match to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the room and descended to my study, where I procured my instruments
      and the requisite anæsthetic.

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;MIRIAM BENARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> watched her
      carefully as she recovered from the effects of the ether. An uncommonly
      small quantity of that drug had sufficed to deprive her of her senses; and
      now her recovery was unusually speedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having taken her respiration, her temperature, and her pulse, and having
      found each to be nearly normal, I looked her straight in the eyes, and
      demanded, making every syllable clear and emphatic, &ldquo;Louise Massarte, do
      you know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had I addressed my inquiry to a month-old infant, the result would have
      been the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeated the question in French: &ldquo;Louise Massarte, <i>me reconnaissez
      vous?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;with precisely the same negative result.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then wrote the question both in French and English upon a slip of paper,
      and held it before her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sign of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end I applied tests to each of her five senses, and satisfied
      myself that each was unimpaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which, &ldquo;Well, Josephine,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;unless all signs fail, we have
      succeeded to admiration. None of her senses have sustained the slightest
      injury, yet she has lost the knowledge of language, both spoken and
      written. Louise Massarte is dead, annihilated, abolished from the face of
      creation. This is a new-born infant, this apparently full-grown woman
      lying here. Her soul is still to develop and unfold itself. It will be for
      us to shape it, to colour it, to direct it towards good or evil. Heredity
      has furnished the capacities, the propensities, which her environment will
      quicken, stimulate, cause to grow and to ripen. And it is for us to
      provide and to regulate that environment. May Heaven guide our labours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen, heartily. It is an awful responsibility. And yet&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I cannot help hoping for the best. Look at her, brother. See how
      beautiful she is. Surely, such a beautiful face must be meant to go with a
      beautiful spirit. Already the expression of bitterness, of hardness, of
      suspicion, seems to have faded from it. It is as if it had been washed in
      some element infinitely cleansing. I never saw a more innocent face than
      hers has become already. Yes, I am sure we may hope for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for the present, we need concern ourselves only for the welfare of
      her body. We must darken the room. Inflammation is the only ill
      consequence we have to fear; and that can be averted, if we keep her in
      darkness and in silence until the wound has healed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wound healed quickly. Not an unpleasant symptom of any kind manifested
      itself. And, as I had foreseen she would do, our patient relearned the
      primary lessons of life with an ease and a rapidity that seemed almost
      incredible. I had anticipated this because she was an adult; because, that
      is to say, her brain, as an organ, was of mature development.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to speak as soon as ever we allowed ourselves to speak in her
      presence, at first simply imitating the sounds we made, but very speedily
      coming to employ words with understanding. A single lesson taught her how
      to walk. After my sister had dressed her twice, she was perfectly well
      able to dress herself&mdash;no trivial achievement when the intricacy of
      the feminine toilet is borne in mind. At the end of an incredibly short
      period of time she could read and write as easily as I can. Of the former
      capability she made good use, devouring eagerly all such books as we
      thought wise to give her. Her progress, in a word, precisely corresponded
      to that made by a bright child, only it was infinitely more rapid; and
      what a fascinating thing it was to observe, I need not stop to tell. It
      was like watching the growth and blossoming of some most wonderful and
      beautiful flower. We were permitted, so to speak, to be eye-witnesses of a
      miracle. If you had met her at the expiration of one year, and had
      conversed with her, you would have put her down for a singularly
      intelligent and well-informed, yet at the same time singularly innocent
      and unsophisticated, girl of eighteen. Yes, I mean it&mdash;a girl of
      eighteen. For the most astonishing result of my operation&mdash;most
      astonishing because least expected&mdash;was this: that in body as well as
      in mind she seemed to have been rejuvenated. With the obliteration of her
      memory, every trace of experience faded from her face. You would have laid
      a wager that it was the face of a young maiden not yet out of her teens.
      She had said that she was all but six-and-twenty. It was unbelievable when
      you looked at her now. To the desperate-eyed woman whom I had dissuaded
      from self-destruction on that clouded Bummer's night a year gone by, she
      bore only such a resemblance as a younger sister might have borne. To
      Josephine I remarked, &ldquo;Is it possible that we have builded better than we
      knew? That we have stumbled upon the discovery which the alchemists sought
      in vain&mdash;the Elixir of Youth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Josephine assented, &ldquo;she has grown many years younger. She has
      the appearance and the manner of seventeen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only proves,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the truth of the oft-repeated commonplace: that
      it is experience and not time which ages one; time being simply the
      receptacle and measure of experience. Could we double the rate of our
      experience&mdash;experiencing as much in one year as we are now able to
      experience in two&mdash;we should grow old just twice as quickly, reaching
      at thirty-five the limit which we now reach at threescore-and-ten.
      Contrariwise, could we halve the rate of our experience&mdash;requiring
      two years to experience what we can now experience in one&mdash;we should
      grow old just twice as slowly, being mere boys at forty, and at seventy in
      the very prime of early manhood. Our consciousness of time, in other
      words, is simply the consciousness of so much experience. Well and good.
      Now, in this case, her experience has been undone. That is to say, her
      memory, the storehouse of her experience, has been destroyed. Past time,
      so far as it affects her mind, has been neutralised, has been cancelled
      out of her equation. Hence this return to adolescence. Her bodily
      structure&mdash;the size and shape of her bones, and all that&mdash;of
      course remains as it was. But her spirit returns to the condition of
      youth; and, since it is the spirit which animates the body, it gives to
      her body the expression and the activity of its own age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I offered to perform my operation upon Josephine herself, to the end
      that she also might enjoy a restored youth: which offer Josephine
      haughtily declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very fortunate,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that this alteration in her appearance
      has taken place, for now it will be impossible for anybody who may have
      known her in former days to identify her: a danger which otherwise we
      should have had to fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I acquiesced, &ldquo;that is very true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The disposition which our visitor developed, furthermore, better than
      answered to our most sanguine anticipations. Her new environment vivified
      the best of those propensities which heredity had implanted in her, and
      left dormant those that were for evil. Her quality was so sweet and
      winning, that in a little while she had taken our old hearts captive, and
      become the delight and the treasure of our home. We loved her like a
      daughter; and the notion that we might some time have to part with her was
      intolerable. Therefore, we put our heads together, and entered into a
      pious conspiracy, agreeing to represent to her that she was our niece, the
      child of our brother, an orphan, eighteen years old, by name Miriam, who,
      on the 14th day of June, 1884, had sustained an accident which had
      destroyed her recollection of the past. As our niece, recently arrived
      from England, we introduced her to our friends. She reciprocated our
      affection in the tenderest manner, called us aunt and uncle, and was in
      every respect a blessing to our lives&mdash;so beautiful, so gentle, so
      merry, so devoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mysterious and impressive circumstance I must not for one moment
      allow to be lost sight of:&mdash;That, of all living human beings, she who
      least suspected that such a woman as Louise Massarte had ever lived,
      sinned, suffered, was Miriam Benary. She upon whom Louise Massarte's life,
      sins, and sufferings had least effect or influence, was Miriam Benary. Her
      identity was in every respect as separate, and as distinct from that of
      Louise Massarte, as mine is from my reader's. Louise Massarte was dead,
      dead utterly. Into her tenement of clay a new soul had entered It was a
      fearful and wonderful metamorphosis, rich in suggestiveness; a <i>datum</i>,
      it seems to me, bearing importantly upon three sciences: Psychology,
      Divinity, and Ethics.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus nearly four years elapsed, and it was Monday, the 12th day of March,
      1888, the day of the memorable snowstorm, called the Blizzard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;WITHIN AN ACE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n that day certain
      imperative business demanded my presence in the lawyer's quarter of the
      town. I had been summoned, in short, to appear as a witness in a
      litigation that was pending in the Court of Common Pleas&mdash;a summons
      which I felt myself the more disposed to obey inasmuch as a penalty of two
      hundred and fifty dollars attached to contempt of it. Therefore, despite
      the unprecedented brutality of the weather, and against the earnest
      remonstrances of Josephine and Miriam, I was foolhardy enough to venture
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock on our drawing-room mantel marked a few minutes before ten when
      I left the house, my immediate destination being the Jefferson Street
      Station of the Overhead Railway&mdash;distant not more than a quarter of a
      mile from my own door, and in ordinary circumstances an easy five minutes'
      walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it must be remembered, I was at that time within a few months of
      completing my seventieth year; and such a storm was raging, and such a
      gale blowing, as might have strained the mettle of a youngster one third
      my age: a veritable tempest, indeed, the like of which Adironda had never
      in the memory of man experienced before. The mercury stood below zero
      Fahrenheit; the wind was travelling at the pace of sixty miles an hour;
      and the snow was falling in such unheard of quantities as to obscure the
      air like fog. I don't mind owning, therefore, that I was pretty badly
      exhausted when I arrived at my journey's end, and that I had consumed a
      good half-hour in the process of getting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      My path, as it were, had led through one continuous and unbroken drift,
      knee-deep at its shallowest, waist-high at its average, and frequently
      engulphing me up to my chin. Through this I had dug and ploughed my way,
      with the wind cold and furious in my teeth, and under a running fire of
      snow-flakes, frozen so hard, and driven with such force, that they stung
      my face like bird-shot, and nearly put out my eyes. I can assure the
      reader that it was no child's play. My nose and ears, from burning as if
      in a bath of scalding water, had become numb and rigid, like features of
      wood. The moisture from my breath had congealed in my beard, until that
      appendage felt like an iron mask. My legs were stiff and heavy. My
      shoulders ached. My respiration had become painful and laborious; my
      heart-action so faint as to induce sickness similar to that which one
      suffers at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, to cap the climax, when I reached the station, I found a
      chain stretched across the entrance to the booking-office, and a placard
      announcing that no trains were running! So that I had earned my labour for
      my pains; and there was nothing for me to do but to turn my face back
      toward home, and retrace my steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exhausted as I was, then, I set forth at once upon that undertaking. Of
      course, it was excessively imprudent for me to do so, without first
      seeking shelter in some public house, and resting there until I had got
      warmed through, and in a measure recovered my strength. But I suppose I
      did not realise at the moment how far gone I was; and the prospect of
      regaining the comfort of my own fireside was a deliciously tempting one.
      So off I started, down Jefferson Street, towards Myrtle Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon, however, I had reason to repent my rashness. A hundred yards or
      thereabouts from the corner, a mountainous drift of snow stretched
      diagonally across the road. I was half blinded; my wits were half frozen;
      I underestimated both its depth and its width, and plunged boldly into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next instant I found myself buried up to my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struggled to push on. My legs were as immovable as if bound with ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I strove to dig myself free with my hands. My arms, too, I learned,
      were pinioned as in a strait-waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a pleasant predicament, and one that constantly increased in
      interest; for, to say nothing of the deadly and aggressive cold, the snow
      was pouring down upon me by the bucket-full; and I appreciated very
      vividly the fact that unless I speedily effected an escape, I should be
      covered over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      My only hope, it was obvious, lay in calling for assistance. Whether other
      human beings were within hearing distance or not, I had no means of
      discovering; for, so opaque was the atmosphere rendered by the multitude
      of snow-flakes that filled it, I could see nothing beyond a radius of two
      or three yards; and even the houses that lined the street were
      indistinguishable, except when, by fits and starts, for a second at a
      time, the wind rent asunder the veil that hid them. Nevertheless, my only
      hope lay in trying the experiment of a cry for help; and that accordingly
      I did, with the utmost energy I could command:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at the sound of my voice, my heart sank. It was the still, small ghost
      of itself, to such a degree had the exposure and the hardship of the last
      half-hour depleted my physical resources; and besides, dampened by the
      blanket of snow in which I was enveloped, and lost in the roar of the
      hurricane, the likelihood that it would carry beyond a rod in any
      direction seemed infinitesimally slight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am lost,&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;Here, not five hundred yards from my own
      doorstep, lost as hopelessly as if wrecked in mid-ocean. Ah, well! they
      say death by freezing is comparatively painless. Anyhow, it will soon be
      over. Yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, with the desperate unreasonableness of a man in extremities&mdash;like
      him who, drowning, clutches at a chip&mdash;I repeated my feeble signal of
      distress: &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited half a minute, and then repeated it for a third time: &ldquo;Help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conceive my emotions, to hear instantly, and from immediately behind me,
      the response, in the lustiest of baritones: &ldquo;Hello, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; I gasped. Then: &ldquo;Can you help me out of this drift?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That remains to be tried,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;I shouldn't wonder, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And therewith I felt myself seized by two strong arms, lifted bodily from
      off my feet, and a moment later set down upon a spot of the pavement which
      the wind had swept clean, where I had a chance to see and to thank mv
      rescuer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;A CHANCE ACQUAINTANCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e was a tall and
      athletic-looking man, perhaps thirty years old, with a ruddy,
      good-humoured face, an honest pair of blue eyes, and a curling yellow
      beard. He wore a sealskin cap which came down over his ears, sealskin
      gloves which reached up above his coat-sleeves nearly to his elbows, a
      pea-jacket, and rubber top-boots. His beard, his eyebrows, and so much of
      his hair as was exposed, were dense with frozen snow, and from his
      moustache depended a series of icicles, like tusks, where his breath had
      condensed and congealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I have to thank you for saving my life,&rdquo; I began, in such voice
      as I could muster, and I noticed that my utterance was thick, like that of
      a drunken man. &ldquo;A very little more and I had been done for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you were in rather a nasty box,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But all's well that
      ends well; and you're safe enough now. When I heard you calling, I thought
      it was a child, your voice was so thin and faint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's highly fortunate for me that you heard me at all. I had given myself
      up for lost. What a storm this is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; glorious, isn't it? It's the grandest spectacle I've ever seen. I
      tell you, sir, it's well for us that Nature should occasionally show us
      her sharp claw; otherwise we'd get to considering her a quite tame
      domestic pet, which she's not by any means. She's man's hereditary foe;
      there stands a perpetual feud between her and us, a <i>vendetta</i> handed
      down from father to son, from generation to generation. It's only by the
      exercise of an eternal vigilance and industry that we manage to subsist in
      spite of her. She's constantly striving, one way or another, to
      exterminate us: freeze us out, roast us out, starve us out&mdash;I know
      not what all. Here we are, huddled together upon this bleak, mysterious
      planet, parasites upon its surface, like mould on cheese, sheltering
      ourselves in fortresses of straw&mdash;wondering whence we came, why we're
      here, whither we're bound, and what the fun of the whole thing is&mdash;while
      she whirls us through her dark immensities, and seeks hourly to shake us
      off; which is rather unmannerly of her, seeing it was she herself who
      brought us here. Life which she gives us with one hand, she withholds with
      the other. She begrudges what she lavishes. Oh, it is strange, it is
      magnificent; it's some grand paradoxical farce, which we haven't wit
      enough to see the point of. Still, there's an exhilaration in the
      conflict, unequal though it is. She's sure to win in the end; she plays
      with us like a cat with a mouse, amused at our desperate antics, but
      confident of her power to administer a quietus when they begin to pall;
      yet there's a pleasure, somehow, in the struggle. They say, you know, the
      fox enjoys being hunted. To-day she's in a particularly frolicsome mood,
      and puts vim into her buffets. For my part, I'm grateful to her. She'll
      laugh best, because she'll laugh last; but she can't prevent my relishing
      my laugh meanwhile. I have not lived in vain, who have lived to experience
      this storm. Isn't it stimulating? I vow, it makes a man feel like a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had stood shivering, teeth chattering, while he delivered himself of
      this extraordinary harangue. Now, &ldquo;That would depend somewhat upon the age
      and the physique of the man,&rdquo; I stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, true enough. Your observation is altogether apposite and just.
      But for me, I declare, it is like wine. Which way do you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go east and south&mdash;to my home, which is in Riverview Road, if you
      know where that is. But to tell you the truth, I doubt my ability to go at
      all. <i>I'm</i> pretty badly used up. I think I shall ask to be taken in
      at one of these neighbouring houses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like it. But I know where River-view Road is; in fact I'm bound in
      that direction myself, being curious to see how the storm affects the
      Yellow Snake. It must be a sight for the gods&mdash;the writhing and the
      lashing of the reptile river under such a wind. If you please we'll march
      together. I suspect, with my assistance, you'll be able to arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've already saved my life, and now you offer to see me safely home. I
      shall owe you a heavy debt. But I could never consent to take you out of
      your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I've already had the honour to intimate, that's precisely what you
      won't do. I was bound for the riverside&mdash;upon my word. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the next thing I knew, my robust interlocutor had again lifted me from
      my feet, and was trudging off towards Myrtle Avenue, bearing me like a
      child in his arms&mdash;which, of course, was altogether too ignominious a
      position for me to occupy without protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is needless. I beg of you to put me down. Really, I can't submit
      to this. Let me walk at your side, and lean upon your arm, and I shall do
      very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;permit me to observe&mdash;and I beseech you
      not to resent the observation as personal&mdash;that if ever a mortal man
      was completely tuckered out, you are. You've lost your wind, and your legs
      are as shaky as if you had the palsy. Pardon my austere frankness&mdash;the
      circumstances compel it. You couldn't get as far as the corner yonder to
      save your neck. You are, to employ the politest of modern languages, <i>hors
      de combat</i>. You are <i>ansgespielt</i>, you are <i>non compos corporis</i>&mdash;that
      is to say, in pure Americanese, you are <i>busted</i>. Now, so far as I am
      concerned, on the contrary, I don't mind carrying you any more than I
      would a baby. At the outside you don't weigh ten stone; and what's the
      like of that to a fellow of my horse-power? Lie still, and I sha'n't know
      you're there. Lie still and rest, recover your breath, and be yourself
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the thing is too ridiculous. I can't in dignity consent to it, I
      entreat you to put me down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I attempted to release myself, but his arms were like bands of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there&mdash;resign yourself! I prithee, wriggle not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      shall put you down presently&mdash;when the time is ripe. And as for your
      dignity, remember the device of Cæsar: <i>Esée quant videri</i>. This,
      sir, is an occasion for choosing between appearances and a very grim
      reality. I can understand that, other things equal, you wouldn't care to
      have the world see us in our present situation; but console yourself with
      the reflection that the storm answers every purpose of a dose of
      fern-seed, and renders us beautifully invisible. Anyhow, I take it, your
      dignity isn't as precious to you as your health; and I will go bail for
      this, that if you tried to foot it another hundred yards, you'd pay for
      your temerity with a fit of sickness. Consider, furthermore, that I am old
      enough to be your son. Let me play a son's part for the nonce, and carry
      you home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have no right to quarrel with you,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;but you place me
      under an obligation which I shall never be able to discharge. It will bear
      as heavily upon my conscience as I now weigh upon your muscles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it will cause you mighty slight annoyance. To tell you the truth,
      it's a jolly good lark for me. It's an added excitement, a most
      interesting adventure; and it will provide a capital chapter for the
      winter's tale that I shall have to tell. But a truce to talk. Let's waste
      no further breath in that way. You lie still there and meditate. I'll
      devote my energies to the business of getting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So for a good while we forbore speech. At length, &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he
      announced, &ldquo;here's Riverview Road. Our toilsome journey's o'er; and, all
      our perils past, in harbour safe at last we rest. What would you more?&mdash;What's
      your number?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixty-three, the fourth house from the corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here you are on your own doorstep.&mdash;There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He set me upon my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, sir,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;trusting that you may suffer no ill effects
      from your experience, I will wish you farewell. Farewell, a long farewell.
      This is a life made up of partings. Again, farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell by no manner of means,&rdquo; I hastily retorted. &ldquo;You must come in.
      You must do me the honour of entering my house, and allowing me to offer
      you some refreshment. And besides, if, as you said, you are anxious to
      watch the play of the storm upon the river, you could possess no better
      coigne of vantage than one of my back windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an inducement, sir, is superfluous. Your invitation in itself would
      be quite irresistible. For, aside from the pleasure I derive from your
      society, and the instruction from your conversation, I will confidentially
      admit to you that I shall be glad to thaw out my nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened the door with my latch-key, and preceded him into my study.

      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;JOSEPHINE WRITES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> beautiful fire
      was blazing in the grate. The transition from the cold and uproar of the
      street, to the snug quiet and warmth of this cosy book-lined room, was an
      agreeable one, I can tell you. I was pretty well rested by this time; and,
      except for the tingling of my nose, ears, toes, and fingers, felt very
      little the worse for my encounter with the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I to my guest, &ldquo;the tables are turned. But a moment since, I
      was your prisoner; now you are mine. Draw up to the fire. Throw off your
      over jacket and your rubber-boots. I hope you are not wet through; for, we
      are built respectively upon such different patterns, it would be ironical
      for me to offer you dry garments from my wardrobe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need give yourself no uneasiness upon that score, sir. Im as dry as a
      Greek lexicon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, let me at once offer you a drop of something wet,&rdquo; I said,
      producing a decanter and a couple of glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assented, &ldquo;a toothful of this will do neither of us harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We clinked our glasses, and drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried, smacking his lips, &ldquo;sweet ardent spirit of the rye, may
      the shade of Christopher Columbus be fed upon you thrice every day, to
      reward him for the discovery of this continent. I've tasted Irish and I've
      tasted Scotch, Dutch barley-brandy and Slavonic vodka; but of all
      distillations to make glad the inmost heart of man, give me Kentucky rye!
      Another glass? Thank you, kind sir, not e'en another drop. 'Twere
      desecration worthy only of a widower to take a second after so rare a
      first. And now, by-the-bye, since I find myself the beneficiary of your
      hospitality, it behoves me to introduce myself. My name is Henry
      Fairchild, and by trade I am a sculptor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Leonard Benary, physician and surgeon. And I trust, Mr.
      Fairchild, that you have no urgent affairs to call you from my house, for
      I should never feel easy in my mind if I permitted you to leave it before
      this storm has abated; and that doesn't look like an imminent event. My
      affairs are not urgent. In fact, as I believe I have already remarked,
      when we ran across each other I was abroad for my diversion, pure and
      simple. But that is no reason why I should abuse your kindness. If I may
      thaw here before your fire for a half-hour, I shall be in perfect
      condition to make my way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would depend upon the distance of your home from mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My home is in my studio. And my studio is in St. Matthew's Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far! Very well, then. I shall certainly not hear of your leaving me so
      long as the storm continues. It would be as much as your life is worth to
      attempt such a journey in such circumstances. It's a matter of three,
      four, well-nigh five miles. And since all public conveyances are at a
      standstill, you'd have to trust yourself for the whole distance to
      Shanks's mare. I shall count upon your spending the night here, at least.
      There's no prospect of the weather moderating before to-morrow. And now,
      if you will excuse me, I will leave you here for a few moments, while I go
      to change my clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the wisest thing you could possibly do,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I shall
      amuse myself excellently looking out of the window; but as for your kind
      invitation to remain over night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that, since you acknowledge that you have no pressing business to
      call you elsewhere, I will listen to no refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went upstairs, my first care being to make known my return to Josephine
      and Miriam, who, of course, were thereby greatly surprised and relieved.
      They professed they had suffered the acutest anxiety ever since I had left
      the house; and as they listened to the account I gave them of my
      misadventures, they paled and shuddered for very terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fairchild, the young man who came to my rescue, is even now below
      stairs in the library,&rdquo; I concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is he? Then,&rdquo; cried Miriam, addressing Josephine, &ldquo;let us go to him
      at once, and tell him how we thank him. To think that, except for him, my
      uncle might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She completed her sentence by putting her arms
      around my neck, and giving me three of the sweetest kisses that were ever
      given in this world: one on either cheek and one full on the lips. &ldquo;Now,
      sir,&rdquo; she went on, shaking the prettiest of fingers at me, &ldquo;I hope that
      you have learned a lesson, and will never do anything again that we two
      wise women warn you not to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise to be a good, obedient, little old man in the future,&rdquo; I
      replied; and was rewarded for my docility with a fourth kiss&mdash;this
      time imprinted among the wrinkles on my forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two wise women went off downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I joined them as soon as I had got into dry clothing; and we sat down to
      luncheon&mdash;the young sculptor enlivening and entertaining us with a
      flow of droll, high-spirited talk. He and Miriam got on famously together&mdash;chatting,
      laughing, exchanging bits of repartee, with the vivacity that was becoming
      to their age. Josephine and I hearkened and enjoyed. At least, I enjoyed;
      and I had no reason to suppose that my sister did not. Luncheon concluded,
      we adjourned to the drawing-room. There, observing the piano, Fairchild
      demanded of Miriam whether she played. She answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; (We had
      procured for her the best musical instruction to be had in Adironda; and
      she had mastered the instrument with a facility which proved that Louise
      Massarte must have been a talented pianist.) Miriam answered, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and
      then Fairchild said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not be persuaded to play for us now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She played one of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodies, and then something of
      Chopin's, and then something of Schumann's; after which, leaving the
      piano, she said to Fairchild&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you must sing for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how do you know I can sing?&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident from the <i>timbre</i> of your voice,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not be too sure of that,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;The speaking voice and
      the singing voice are two very different things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, please sing for us,&rdquo; she repeated.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said he, taking possession of the key-board, &ldquo;I will sing for
      you; but at your peril. The beauty of the song, however, may perhaps be
      allowed to atone for the deficiencies of my execution. It is by the
      English composer, Marzials, a man of the rarest genius, too little known
      out of his own country. He wrote both words and music, and the song is
      entitled 'Never Laugh at Love.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therewith, to his own accompaniment, he sang in his sweet baritone one of
      the pleasantest and wittiest songs of its kind that I have ever heard.

      I cannot forbear quoting that one verse, to give a notion of the quaint
      mediæval charm of the words. * I wish I could transcribe the melody as
      well, which was delicious with the same quaint flavour.

      Fairchild having finished his song, he and Miriam plunged into an animated
      conversation about music in the abstract, which I, for one&mdash;being,
      though an ardent lover of music, no musician&mdash;found of dubious
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherefore, I think,&rdquo; I interrupted them to say, &ldquo;if you will forgive the
      breach of ceremony, Mr. Fairchild, I shall retire to my bedroom for a bit,
      and take a nap. I feel somewhat fatigued after the exertions of the
      forenoon; and, anyhow, I am accustomed to my forty winks at this hour of
      the day. I am sure I leave you in good hands when I leave you to my sister
      and my niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Dr. Benary, the kindest thing you can do for me&mdash;you and
      your good ladies&mdash;will be to let me feel that in no wise do I
      interfere with your convenience or your pleasure. Otherwise, I shall be
      compelled to take my departure <i>instanter</i>; and I confess that by
      this time I am so deeply penetrated by the comfort of your interior that I
      should hate mortally to renew close quarters with the storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I withdrew to my bed-chamber, and was sound asleep in no time. Nor did
      I wake till the mellow booming of the Japanese gong, which serves as
      dinner-bell in our establishment, broke in upon my slumbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I rose to my feet, something dropped from the counterpane to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping to pick it up, I discovered that it was a sheet of paper, folded
      in the form of a cocked hat, and bearing my name written across it in
      Josephine's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What earthly occasion can Josephine have for writing me a note?&rdquo; I
      wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donning my spectacles, I read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ever shall we do? I cannot come and say this to you in person, for I
      dare not leave them alone together. But he has recognised Miriam!&mdash;J.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took fully a minute for the significance of that sentence: &ldquo;He has
      recognised Miriam,&rdquo; to percolate my understanding, still thick with the
      dregs of sleep. Then I started as if I had been stung; and rushing into
      the passage, I called &ldquo;Josephine! Josephine!&rdquo; at the top of my lungs.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he passage was
      quite dark. From the end of it, directly behind me, came the response,
      &ldquo;Yes, Leonard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are there?&rdquo; I questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been waiting for you to wake. I did not wish to disturb your
      sleep,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they&mdash;where are they now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fairchild is in the guest-chamber, where he is to sleep. Miriam is in
      her room. I could not come to you so long as they were together. It would
      not do to leave them alone. That is why I wrote the note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time we were between my own four walls, and I had closed the door
      behind us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, for Heaven's sake, explain to me what this means,&rdquo; I said,
      holding up the sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means what it says. He has recognised Miriam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is impossible,&rdquo; I declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish you were right,&rdquo; sighed Josephine dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how&mdash;but why&mdash;but what&mdash;what makes you think so?&rdquo;
       stammered I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His action when he first saw her&mdash;when she and t entered the room
      where he was, to greet him, this forenoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is impossible&mdash;impossible!&rdquo; I repeated, helplessly. &ldquo;What was
      his action? What did he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He caught his breath, he started, he coloured up, and then turned white,
      and then red again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful Heavens!&rdquo; I gasped, panic-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do? What can we do?&rdquo; my poor sister groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did&mdash;did Miriam notice his embarrassment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. She did not appear to, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There befell a pause, during which I tried to collect my wits, and to
      reflect upon the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; persisted Josephine, after the silence had continued for a minute
      or two, &ldquo;what shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible, it is absolutely impossible,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Her own mother
      would be unable to recognise her. She is altered beyond recognition. Why,
      that dead woman would by this time be nearly thirty years of age; whereas
      Miriam doesn't look two-and-twenty. Besides, the whole character and
      expression of her face are changed. There remain the same bony structure
      and the same general complexion: that is all that remains the same.
      Confess that the thing is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he saw her, he started and coloured up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, even so. What of it. He started and coloured up. What does that
      prove? Perhaps it was because of her resemblance to the dead woman, whom
      we will suppose him to have known. But as for identifying them as one and
      the same, he'd never dream of it. A merry, innocent young girl, of one or
      two-and-twenty, and a sad-eyed, sorrow-stricken, sinful woman, eight years
      her senior! The thing is on the face of it absurd. Absurd, too, is the
      supposition that he ever knew Louise Massarte at all. He started and
      coloured up at sight of Miriam, for the very simple reason of her
      exceeding beauty. He is a young man, and he is an artist. What
      quick-blooded young man, what artist, would not colour up at the sight of
      so beautiful a girl? Or else, it is imaginable, he has seen Miriam herself
      somewhere before&mdash;in the street, in an omnibus, or where not&mdash;and
      has been impressed by her loveliness; and then he started for surprise and
      pleasure at finding himself under the same roof with her. You, my good
      Josephine, you have jumped to a most unwarranted conclusion. Your fear was
      the father of your thought.&mdash;Afterwards, for instance? Did he follow
      up his start with such conduct as was calculated to justify you in your
      suspicion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He simply returned our salutations, and behaved toward her as he did
      toward me&mdash;as if she were a perfectly new acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! And then, consider the freedom and the nonchalance with which he
      talked to her at luncheon. No, no; it is impossible. Well, I will keep an
      eye upon him during dinner. And when you and Miriam leave us to our
      cigars, I'll seek to find out what the true explanation of the matter may
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And my sister and I descended to the drawing-room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;REASSURANCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hroughout the meal
      that followed, I carefully observed Fairchild's bearing toward my niece;
      and great was my satisfaction to see in it only and exactly what under the
      circumstances could rightly have been expected. Frank, gay, interested,
      attentive, yet undeviatingly courteous, respectful, and even deferential,
      it was precisely the bearing due from a young gentleman of good breeding
      toward the lady at whose side he found himself, and whose acquaintance he
      had but lately made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that,&rdquo; I concluded, &ldquo;of all conceivable theories adequate to account
      for his behaviour at first setting eyes upon her, Josephine's is the
      farthest-fetched and the least tenable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the matter of that, as I had assured my sister, I was confident that
      her own mother, had she been alive, must have failed to identify her, so
      essentially was she altered both in expression of countenance and in
      apparent age, to say nothing of her totally transformed personality. That
      Fair-child did not do so I was certain. His manner exhibited neither
      surprise, mystification, curiosity, nor constraint. It would have required
      a far cunninger hypocrite than I took him to be, so effectually to have
      disguised such emotions, had he really felt them; and he could not have
      helped feeling them if, having known the dead woman, Louise Massarte, he
      had recognised her in the young and unsophisticated maiden, Miriam Benary.
      The right theory by which to explain his conduct at first meeting her, I
      purposed discovering, if I could, when he and I were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Miriam had a deal of fun together making the salad, in which
      enterprise they collaborated&mdash;not, however, without much laughing
      difference as to the best method of procedure. He pretended that, instead
      of rubbing the bowl with garlic, one should introduce a <i>chapon</i>&mdash;or
      crust of bread discreetly tinctured with that herb&mdash;and &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo; it
      with the lettuce: whereas our niece vigorously maintained the contrary.
      And finally they drew lots to determine which policy should prevail,
      Miriam winning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am defeated but not disheartened,&rdquo; Fair-child declared. &ldquo;If there is
      anything upon which I pride myself, Miss Benary, it is my erudition in the
      science, and my dexterity in the art, of gastronomy. You have taken it out
      of my power to display my skill in salad-making; but now, if you are a
      generous victor, you will give me an opportunity to distinguish myself in
      the confection of an omelet. It is an omelet of my own invention, a sort
      of cross between the ordinary <i>omelette-au-vin</i> of the French and the
      Italian <i>zabaiano</i>, I shall require the use of that chafing dish and
      spirit-lamp which I see yonder on the sideboard, the sherry decanter, and
      half a dozen eggs. I can promise your palates a delectable experience; and
      you, Miss Denary, by watching me, will acquire an invaluable talent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, with much merriment, he proceeded with the manufacture of his omelet,
      Miriam observing and assisting. When it was complete, we unanimously voted
      it the most delicious thing in the way of an omelet that we had ever
      tasted. But Miriam sighed, and said, &ldquo;It is all very simple except the
      most important point. The way is toss it up into the air, and make it turn
      over, and then catch it again as it descends&mdash;I am sure I shall never
      be able to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never? That is a long word. You must practise it with beans,&rdquo; said
      Fairchild. &ldquo;A pint of beans&mdash;dry beans&mdash;the kind Bostonians use
      for baking. Three hours daily practice for six months, and you will do it
      almost as easily as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the fruit the ladies left us; and having filled our glasses and
      lighted our cigars, we sipped and smoked for a few minutes without
      speaking. Fairchild was the first to break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do nothing,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but congratulate myself upon the happy
      chance&mdash;if chance it was, and not a kind Providence&mdash;that
      brought about our encounter this morning. For once in my life I was in
      luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that it is I who was in luck, and who have
      the best occasion for self-gratulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would depend upon the dubious question of the value of life,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;Has it ever struck you that this earth of ours is, after all, only a
      huge grave-yard, a colossal burying-ground; and that we living persons are
      simply waiting about&mdash;standing in a long <i>queue</i>, so to speak&mdash;till
      our turn comes to be interred? That seems to me a very pleasing fancy, and
      one which, considered as an hypothesis, clarifies many obscure things.
      Accepting it, we cease to wonder at the phenomenon of death, and regard it
      as the chief end, aim, object, and purpose of all human life&mdash;the
      consummation devoutly to be wished, which we are all attending with
      greater or less impatience. Anyhow, I am sceptical whether we confer a
      boon or inflict a bane upon the human being whom we bring into existence,
      or whose exit therefrom we prevent. It is indeed probable that, except for
      our casual meeting this morning, you would at the present hour have been
      numbered among the honoured dead. But, very likely&mdash;either enjoying
      the excitements of the happy hunting-ground or sleeping the deep sleep of
      annihilation&mdash;very likely, I say, you would have been better off than
      you are actually, or can ever hope to be in the flesh. About my good
      fortune, contrariwise, debate is inadmissible. Here I am in veritable
      clover-smoking a capital cigar after a capital dinner, in capital company,
      to the accompaniment of a capital glass of wine, and the richer by the
      acquisition of three new friends&mdash;for as friends, I trust, I may be
      allowed to reckon you and your ladies. Had we not happened to run across
      each other in the way we did, on the other hand, I should now have been
      seated alone by my bachelor's hearth, with no companions more congenial to
      me than my plaster casts, and no voice more jovial to cheer my solitude
      than the howling of the gale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very flattering of you to put the matter as you do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but
      being modish in no respect, I am least of all so in my metaphysics.
      Therefore I cannot share your pessimistic doubt of the value of life; and
      I assure you I should have hated bitterly to leave mine behind me in that
      ungodly snowbank. It is true, I am perilously close to the Scriptural
      limitation of man's age; and I ought perhaps to feel that I have had my
      fit and proper share of this world's vanities, and to be prepared for my
      inevitable journey to the next. But, I must confess, I am so little of a
      philosopher, I should dearly like to tarry here a few years longer; and
      hence, I maintain, my obligation to you is indisputably established.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, so far as I can see, we may say measure for measure; and
      consider ourselves quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. The balance is still tremendously in your favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that we again smoked for a while without speaking. Then again
      Fairchild broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether you would take it amiss, Dr. Benary, if I should mention
      something which has been the object of my delighted admiration almost from
      the moment I entered your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! What is that?&rdquo; I queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you will condemn me as overbold if I answer you candidly; but I
      shall do so, and accept the consequences. The circumstance that I am an
      artist may be pleaded in my behalf, if I seem to transcend the bounds of
      the conventional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pique my curiosity. What is it that you allude to? I do not think you
      need be apprehensive of my wrath. My extended 'Life of Sir Joshua'? That
      is the fruit of ten years' hard labour. Or my Japanese woman by Theodore
      Wores? It's a wonderful piece of flesh-painting. It looks as though it
      would bleed if you pricked it&rdquo; *
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is in Worcs's best vein. But that is not what I have in mind.
      Neither is the 'Life of Sir Joshua.' which, by-the-bye, I have not seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Editor of this work must disclaim all responsibility
     Dr. Benary's opinions upon matters literary and aesthetic.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not seen it? Oh, well, I must show it to you directly we go upstairs.
      It's my particular pet and pride. But what, then? I do not know what else
      I have worthy of such admiration as you profess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have&mdash;if you will tolerate my saying so&mdash;you have a niece;
      and I allude to her extraordinary beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My pulse quickened. Here had he, of his own accord, broached that very
      topic upon which I was anxious to sound him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; Miriam,&rdquo; I assented, a trifle nervously, and wondering what
      would come next. &ldquo;Miriam. Yes, Miriam is a very pretty girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty!&rdquo; echoed he. &ldquo;Pretty? Why, sir, she's&mdash;&mdash; why, in all my
      life I've not seen so beautiful a woman. And it isn't simply that she is
      so beautiful; it's her type. Her type&mdash;I believe I am conservative
      when I call it the least frequent, the rarest, in the whole range of
      womanhood. Forgive my fervour: I speak in my professional capacity&mdash;as
      an artist, as one to whom the beautiful is the subject-matter of his daily
      studies. It is a type of which you occasionally see a perfect specimen in
      antique marble, but in flesh and blood not oftener than once in a
      lifetime. To say nothing of her colouring, which a painter would go mad
      over, consider the sheer planes and lines of her countenance! That
      magnificent sweep of profile&mdash;brow, nose, lips, chin, and throat,
      described by one splendid flowing line! It's unutterable. It's Juno-esque.
      It's worth ten years of commonplaceness to have lived to see it in a
      veritable breathing woman.''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;it's a fine profile&mdash;a noble face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her type is so rare,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that, as I have said, Nature succeeds
      in producing a perfect specimen of it scarcely oftener than once in a
      generation. Of faulty specimens&mdash;comparable, from a sculptor's point
      of view, to flawed castings&mdash;she turns out many every year. You have
      been in Provence? In the Noonday of France? Arles, Tours, Avignon, teem
      with such failures&mdash;women who approach, approach, approach, but
      always fall short of, the perfection that your niece embodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know the Méridionales, and I see the resemblance that you refer
      to. But, as you intimate, they are coarse and crude copies of Miriam. That
      expression of high spirituality, which is the dominant note in her face,
      is usually quite absent from theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They compare to her as the pressed terracotta effigies of the Venus of
      Milo, which may be bought for a song in the streets, compare to the
      chiselled marble in the Louvre. In all my life I have never known but one
      woman who could properly be mentioned in the same breath with her. And
      even she was a good distance behind. Of her I happened to see just enough
      to perceive the divine potentiality of the type. Ever since, I have been
      watching for a faultless specimen. And to-day, when Miss Benary came into
      the room where you had left me, I declare for a moment my breath was taken
      away. I could scarcely believe my eyes. Such beauty seemed beyond reality;
      it was like a dream come true. In my admiration I forgot my manners: it
      was some seconds before I remembered to make my bow. The point of all
      which is that when our friendship is older, you, Dr. Benary, must permit
      <i>me</i> to model her portrait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus was my mind set at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently we rejoined the ladies, and while Fairchild and Miriam chatted
      together in the bow window, I drew Josephine aside, and communicated to
      her the upshot of our post-prandial conversation. She breathed a mighty
      sigh, and professed herself to be enormously relieved.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>airchild became a
      frequent visitor at our house, and an ever-welcome one. His good looks,
      his good sense, his droll humour, his honesty, his high spirits, made him
      an extremely pleasant companion. We all liked him cordially; we were
      always glad to see him. I told him that if pot-luck had no terrors for
      him, he must feel at liberty to drop in and dine with us whenever his
      inclination prompted and his leisure would permit. He took me at my word,
      as I meant he should; and from that time forth he broke bread with us
      never seldomer than one evening out of the seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a month, or perhaps six weeks, Josephine said to me, &ldquo;Do you
      think it well, Leonard, that two young people of opposite sexes should be
      thrown together as frequently and as closely as Mr. Fairchild and Miriam
      are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; questioned I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reasons are obvious. How would you be pleased if they should fall in
      love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord forbid! But I see no danger of their doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always danger when a beautiful young girl and a spirited young
      man see too much of each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Fairchild pays no more attention to Miriam than he does to you or to
      me. They are never left alone together. They are simply good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As yet, perhaps, yes. But time can change friendship into love. He
      begins, you must remember, with the liveliest and most profound admiration
      for her; she, with the deepest sense of gratitude towards him. True, as
      you say, they are never left alone together&mdash;not exactly alone, that
      is. But are they not virtually alone when you and I are seated here in the
      library over our backgammon-board, and he and she are therein the
      drawing-room at the piano?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sister, the two rooms are as one. The folding doors are
      never closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True again: we are all within sight and hearing of one another. But as a
      matter of fact, you and I give no heed to them, nor do they to us. There
      are certain laws of nature which should not be ignored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you want me to do?&rdquo; I enquired rather testily. &ldquo;Shall I
      forbid Fairchild the house? Forbid my house to the man who saved my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, of course not. You know I could not wish such a thing as that.
      Mr. Fairchild's claims upon our gratitude must never be forgotten. And
      besides, I like him, and I enjoy his visits as heartily as you do. Only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what? If I don't forbid him the house, how can I prevent him and
      Miriam meeting? Shall I direct her to keep her room whenever he comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think, brother, it would be well if she were not always present when
      he comes. If you wish to hear my honest opinion, I believe it is to see
      her that he comes so often, and not to see a couple of sober, elderly folk
      like you and me. I cannot think that you and I are so irresistibly
      attractive as to draw him to our house as frequently as once or twice a
      week. However, I only wished to call your attention to the matter. It is
      for you now to act as your best judgment dictates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my good Josephine, I shall not act at all. There is no
      occasion for my acting. I should be most unjust and unreasonable to
      prevent these two young people getting what innocent pleasure they can
      from each other's friendship and society, simply because in the abstract
      it is true that they are not incapable of falling in love. I might, as
      reasonably enjoin Miriam against ever going out of doors, because it is
      possible that in the street she might be run over; against ever drinking a
      glass of water, because it is possible that the water might contain a
      disease-germ. You have conjured up a chimera. Your fears are those of a
      too imaginative woman. When I perceive the first symptom of anything
      sentimental existing between them, it will be time enough to act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps then, Leonard, it will be too late,&rdquo; retorted Josephine, and with
      that she dropped the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, of course, as the reader has foreseen, that very complication which
      my sister feared and warned me of, and which I refused to consider&mdash;of
      course that very complication came to pass. Fairchild fell in love with
      Miriam, and Miriam reciprocated his unfortunate passion. Otherwise his
      name would never have been introduced into this narrative; or, rather,
      there would have been no such narrative for me to recite.
    </p>
    <p>
      In June, 1888, Josephine, Miriam, and I went down to the little village of
      Ogunquit, on the coast of Wade, there to rusticate until the autumn.
      Toward the end of July, Fairchild joined us there, pursuant to an
      arrangement made before we left town; and it was on the evening of the
      15th of August that he requested a few minutes' private talk with me, and
      then informed me of the condition of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love your niece with all my heart and soul, Dr. Benary. Indeed, I have
      loved her from the day I first became acquainted with her&mdash;the day of
      that blessed Blizzard. I should like to know, who could help loving her:
      she is so good and so intelligent, to say nothing of her beauty. To-day I
      emptied my heart out to her, and she has made me the happiest man in
      Christendom by signifying her willingness to become my wife. So, now, it
      only remains for you to give us your approval and benediction. I have an
      income sufficient to keep the wolf from the door, over and above my
      earnings; and for the rest, you know me well enough to judge of my
      eligibility for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What answer could I give him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting aside altogether, as I was bound to do, the selfish consideration
      that her marriage would deprive us of the treasure and the blessing of our
      old age, and leave our home desolate and forsaken&mdash;could I in honour,
      could I in justice to the man, permit him to make Miriam Benary his wife,
      without first imparting to him so much as I myself knew concerning Louise
      Massarte?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the latter was a thing which, I was persuaded, I had no manner of
      right to do. The secret of her connection with Louise Massarte, Miriam
      herself was ignorant of. Surely, no other human being had the shadow of a
      claim to learn it Miriam Benary had never even heard of Louise Massarte.
      Louise Massarte was dead and abolished utterly. Therefore, to saddle
      Miriam, in her youth and her innocence, with that dead woman's name and
      history, to put upon her the burden of the dead woman's sin and shame, it
      would be to do her not only a most grievous, but a most unwarrantable,
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I could not, I would not, I must not, tell Fairchild the story of
      Louise Massarte's annihilation, and the consequent existence of Miriam
      Benary. Yet how could I say, &ldquo;Yes, you may marry her,&rdquo; and keep that story
      to myself? What excuse could I invent wherewith to ease my conscience, if
      I should practise such deceit upon him in an issue that involved his
      dearest and most vital interests? <i>Suppressio veri, suggestio falsi</i>.
      I should be as bad as any liar if I gave my consent to their marriage,
      while allowing him to remain in error respecting the truth about his bride&mdash;truth
      which, if made known to him, might radically modify his intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But furthermore, and on the other hand, suppose I should say in reply to
      his demand, &ldquo;No, you cannot marry her&rdquo;&mdash;what right had I to say that?
      What reason could I allege in justification of my refusal? Not the actual
      reason; for that would be to tell him the very story which, I had made up
      my mind, I must not and should not tell. And if I alleged a fictitious
      reason, I should simply escape the devil to plunge into the deep sea&mdash;I
      should simply exchange a lie for a falsehood. These young people loved
      each other. Therefore, to set up impediments to their union, would be to
      impose upon each of them endless unmerited pain. What right had I to do
      that? It was a vexed and difficult quandary. There were strong arguments
      for and strong arguments against either course out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dr. Benary, you do not answer me,&rdquo; Fairchild said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't answer you. You must give me time&mdash;time to consider, to
      consult my sister, to make up my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had been strolling together, he and I, up and down the sands. Now we
      returned to the inn. Josephine was seated on the verandah, near the
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Leonard, at last!&rdquo; she exclaimed, starting up the moment she caught
      sight of me. &ldquo;I have been waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I accompanied her to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she began, as soon as the door was closed behind us, &ldquo;the worst
      has happened, as I suppose you know. Mr. Fairchild has spoken to you, has
      he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then you, too, know about it?&rdquo; queried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miriam has just told me the whole story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Mr. Fairchild has asked her to be his wife; that she loves him, and
      has accepted him&mdash;conditionally, that is, upon your approval.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says she loves him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says she loves him with all her heart. She says she is as happy as
      the day is long. She doesn't dream that you will have any hesitation about
      consenting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a little while we were silent. At last, &ldquo;Well, what are you going to
      do?&rdquo; my sister asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I wish to advise with you about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you given any answer to Mr. Fair-child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said to him that I must take time for reflection, and for
      consultation with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is a most difficult dilemma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have got to make up your mind, one way or the other; and that
      speedily. It is cruel to keep them in suspense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, my dear sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say yes or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just it. That's just the difficulty, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a difficulty which must be solved. You will have to say one of
      the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare I say yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They love each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right have I to say no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is their life-happiness which is at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, exactly; therefore, if I say no, it will be to condemn them both
      to great misery, and misery which they have done nothing to deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly will&mdash;it will break Miriam's heart. And what reason can
      you give them for saying no? It will seem all the harder to them, because
      it will seem so unreasonable and unnecessary, so unjustifiable and wanton.
      They will feel that it is an act of wilful cruelty, on the part of a
      selfish, tyrannical old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, I know it,&rdquo; I groaned. &ldquo;And yet, on the other hand, if I say
      yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say yes, you will assure to them the greatest happiness their
      hearts can desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how dare I say yes without sharing with Fairchild the secret of
      Miriam's origin? Without telling him the story of Louise Massarte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, you cannot purpose doing that! You cannot mean to confide to
      another knowledge affecting her which she herself is unaware of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not. But there's just the rub. How, without doing that, how
      can I honourably permit him to make her his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a choice of evils: to break their hearts or to suppress certain
      facts. You must choose the lesser evil of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very easily said. But the trouble is to determine which of the
      two evils <i>is</i> the lesser. Deceit or cruelty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, my dear brother, for reminding you of it: but if you had
      listened to my warning in the first place, this painful alternative would
      never have come about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could I do? You yourself agreed with me that I couldn't forbid
      Fairchild the house. And so long as he had the run of the house, how could
      I prevent him and Miriam meeting? And meeting as frequently as they did, I
      suppose it was inevitable that they should come to love each other.
      There's no use reproaching me&mdash;no use regretting the past. What was
      bound to happen has happened. That's the whole truth of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not intend to reproach you, Leonard. I merely wished to say that,
      since, in a manner, you have been responsible for the state of things
      which has come to pass&mdash;since, in other words, you neglected to take
      such measures as would have prevented that state of things from coming to
      pass&mdash;it seems as if now you were under a sort of moral obligation
      not to stand between them and their happiness. The time for action was the
      outset. You did not act then. It seems as if you had thereby forfeited
      your right to act. Since you have allowed things to go so far, it seems as
      if you had no right to forbid their going farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, you counsel me to consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> do not see how you can do otherwise now. It is too late for you
      to step in and separate them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the point of honour? I am to suppress the truth? I am to stand still
      and suffer Fair-child to make Miriam his wife, in ignorance of certain
      facts which, if he were aware of them, might totally change his feeling?
      How can I do that? It would lie for ever on my conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far from totally changing his feeling I do not believe those facts, if
      Fairchild knew them, would weigh with him so much as one hair's weight.
      They would not, if his love for Miriam is love in any vital sense of the
      word. He would agree with us in looking upon her as an entirely different
      person from Louise Massarte. However, he must not know, he must not even
      dream those facts. Therefore, as I said before, it is a choice of evils.
      The negative evil of suppressing the truth does not seem to me so great as
      the positive evil of inflicting pain. Besides, after all, is it not
      Miriam's prerogative to decide this matter for herself? What right have
      you or I to do anything but stand aside, with hands off, and let her
      choose her husband without constraint or interference? She is of full age
      and sound mind; and our relationship with her, which would give us our
      pretence for interfering, is, as you know, only a fiction She could not
      wish for a better husband than Mr. Fairchild. No woman could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say, my dear Josephine, and what you suggest, are Jesuitry, pure
      and simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There come emergencies in which Jesuitry is the only feasible policy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed. In the end, &ldquo;Where is Miriam now?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was in her room when I left her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you find her, and send her to me? Or rather, bring her. You must be
      present, too, to lend me countenance&mdash;to give me moral support in the
      grossly immoral action which I am going to perpetrate. I feel like a
      pickpocket. I need the encouragement of my accomplice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josephine went off. In three minutes she returned, leading Miriam by the
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miriam's cheeks and throat turned crimson as she saw me; and she dropped
      her eyes, and stood still, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I called, holding out my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to me, and put her arms around my neck, and buried her face upon
      my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this young rascal of a sculptor has asked you to be his wife?&rdquo; I
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured, scarcely louder than a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so&mdash;the double-faced rogue!&mdash;it was not, as we had
      supposed, because of his great fondness for your aunt and uncle, that he
      became a frequenter of our camp, but because he had covetous designs upon
      our chief treasure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but he is very fond of my aunt and uncle, too,&rdquo; she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he, indeed! Well, what answer have you given him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said&mdash;I said I&mdash;I said I liked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I see. You said you liked him. That was rather irrelevant, wasn't it?&mdash;a
      little evasive? He asked you to become his wife, and you said you liked
      him. Did you give him no more categorical an answer than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said he must ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me? Ask me what? It isn't I that he wants to marry. And I wouldn't
      have him, anyhow. Why should he ask me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean. I told him I could not marry without your consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose I should withhold my consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very unhappy.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;But I don't really see what my consent matters. It's for you to decide.
      You're of full age. I have no right to forbid you. Now, then, what are you
      going to do?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;I said I would be his wife, unless you wished otherwise.&rdquo;

      the anxious seat to learn his fate. I really think, instead of tarrying
      here, you ought to seek him out, and put an end to his suspense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hugged me and kissed me, and said some very jubilant and some very
      complimentary things; and then she began to cry, and then she laughed
      through her tears; and at last she went off to find her lover, and to
      convey to him the joyful tidings.

      They were married on the 15th day of December, and that same afternoon
      they set sail for Havre aboard the steamship <i>La Touraine</i>, to pass
      six months abroad. Anxiously did Josephine and I count the days that must
      elapse before the post would bring us their first letter; and little did
      we dream what ominous news that letter would contain.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;NATURE BEGINS REPRISALS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>F course, we
      watched the newspapers for an announcement of the <i>Touraine's</i>
      arrival. A fast steamer, ordinarily accomplishing the passage within seven
      days, she ought to have reached Havre on the 22nd. She was not reported,
      however, until Monday, the 24th, being then two days overdue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on Friday, the 4th of January, that we at last got a letter. The
      envelope was superscribed not in Miriam's band, but in Fairchild's; and
      when we tore it open we saw that the letter itself had been written by the
      groom, and not by the bride. This struck us as rather odd, and made us a
      little uneasy. We hastened to read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hôtel de la Grande Bretagne,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Havre, December 25.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Dr. Benary,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christmas day, and such news as I have to give you! I should put off
      writing until we reach Paris, in the hope that when we are there the face
      of things may have altered for the better; only I know, if you don't
      receive a letter sooner than you would in that case, you will be alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have to tell you is so horrible in itself, it must shock you
      dreadfully whatever way I put it. I can't hope to make it any less painful
      for you by mincing it, or beating about the bush. Yet it seems brutal to
      state the hideous fact downright. Miriam has become blind, totally blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether incurably so or not, we do not yet know. Of course we hope for
      the best, but we can be sure of nothing till we reach Paris, where we
      shall consult the best oculists to be found. Meantime, you may imagine our
      state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had a most frightful passage, and that was the cause of it. We ran
      into a storm directly we left Cape Thunderhead; and it followed us all the
      way across. Bad enough at the outset, it got steadily worse and worse
      until we reached port. It had only this mitigation&mdash;it was behind us,
      and moved in the same direction with us. Therefore we were delayed but
      about forty-eight hours. If it had been against us, there's no telling
      when we should have got ashore; and twenty-four hours more of it Miriam
      could never have survived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For six consecutive days (from the 17th to the 23rd) the hatches were
      battened down; no passengers were allowed on deck; and not only were the
      port-holes kept permanently closed, but the inner iron shutters were
      screwed up, lest the sea should break in and swamp us. The skylights also
      were, covered. Thus daylight was excluded, as well as fresh air. Then the
      electric-lighting machine got out of order, and we had to fall back upon
      candles and petroleum. The atmosphere in the cabins became something
      unendurable. Much of the time, owing to the violent motion, it was
      impossible to keep even the candles or the petroleum lamps burning; and we
      were condemned to total darkness. At last, however, they got the electric
      machine into running gear again, so that we had light. From second to
      second, day and night, the sea broke over us with a roar like the
      discharge of cannon, making every timber of the ship creak and tremble. It
      was enough to drive one frantic, that everlasting rhythmic thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all the while we were tossed up, down, and around, as if that giant
      vessel were a cockle-shell. Standing erect or walking was not to be
      thought of. I had to creep from place to place on hands and knees. And
      then the never-ending motion, and the incessant noise: the howling of the
      wind, the pounding of the water, the creaking of timbers, the snapping of
      cordage, the clanking of chains, the crashing of loose things being
      knocked about, the shouts and tramping of sailors overhead, the groans of
      sea-sick people, the shrieks of scared women and children, the darkness,
      the loathsome air&mdash;I tell you it was frightful; it was like
      pandemonium gone mad; the memory of it is like the memory of a nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miriam suffered excruciatingly from seasickness. It was the most
      heart-rending sight I have ever witnessed, the agony she endured. I had
      never dreamed that sea-sickness could be so terrible; and the ship's
      surgeon said he had never seen so severe a case. What made it worse, of
      course, was the hopelessness of her obtaining any relief until the storm
      abated, or until we reached shore. There was nothing anyone could do. I
      just sat there beside her, and held her hand, while she either lay
      exhausted, or started up and went through the torments of the damned. I
      can give you no idea of what she suffered. It was hard work to sit still
      there, and watch her sufferings, and realise that I was utterly powerless
      to help her in any way. From Monday, the 17th, until last night, when we
      had been ashore some hours&mdash;precisely one week&mdash;she did not
      taste food. Once in a while she would drink a little water, with a drop of
      brandy in it; but even that distressed her cruelly. On the 20th she was
      seized with convulsions, awful beyond description. From then on, until we
      left the ship, she simply alternated between terrible paroxysms and utter
      prostration. Four days! I thought she was going to die, her convulsions
      were so violent, the prostration that ensued was so death-like. The ship's
      surgeon himself admitted that there was great danger&mdash;that death
      might result from exhaustion. For those four days&mdash;from the 20th to
      the 24th&mdash;he kept her almost constantly under the influence of
      opiates. On Saturday she seemed a little better&mdash;that is, her
      convulsions occurred seldomer, and were of shorter duration. When not in
      convulsions, she would lie in a stupor, as if asleep, only most of the
      time her eyes were half open, and she would groan. But on Sunday she was
      worse again; and it was on Sunday night, about ten o'clock, that, after
      she had lain perfectly quiet for an hour or so, all at once she started
      up, and asked me whether the electric lights had gone out again. The
      lights were at that moment burning brightly in our state-room; and I told
      her so. Then she cried: 'I can't see you. I can't see anything. It is all
      dark. What has happened? I believe I am blind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I thought it must be some hallucination caused by her
      sickness. I could not believe that she had really become blind. But the
      ship's surgeon came and made an examination, and discovered that it was
      so. He could attribute it only to a paralysis of the optic nerve, the
      consequence of shock and exhaustion. What the danger of its being
      permanent was he could not say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, thank God, that hellish voyage came to an end. The instant we
      reached this hotel, I got her into bed and sent off for the best medical
      men this town holds. They simply corroborated the judgment of the ship's
      doctor&mdash;that she is suffering from shock and exhaustion, and that her
      blindness is due to a paralysis of the optic nerve. <i>They think it will
      probably not be permanent</i>. She must keep her bed until she is
      thoroughly rested, which will take several days. Then we must go to Paris,
      and put her under the treatment of Dr. Geoffroy Désessaires, who, it
      seems, is the great French specialist in diseases of the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in bed now, in the next room, sleeping. She sleeps most of the
      time&mdash;or rather, dozes. Her convulsions are over now, I hope for
      good. But all last night they occurred from time to time&mdash;very much
      less violently, however, than when on ship-board. She has not yet been
      able to take much nourishment, but as often as she wakes, I give her a
      little beef-tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is about all there is to tell down to the present moment. You will
      understand that I am in no condition of mind to write at greater length
      than is necessary, having gone without sleep for the greater part of a
      week, to say nothing of anxiety and distress. When she wakes she talks of
      you and bids me say how she loves you. And of course you always means
      yourself and Miss Josephine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray God that in my next letter I may have more cheering news to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry Fairchild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dismay which the foregoing epistle occasioned Josephine and myself the
      sympathetic reader will conceive without my telling. But it was as nothing
      to that which we experienced when we read the next, and considered its
      purport:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hôtel de la Bourdonnaye,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris, January 1, 1889.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Dr. Benary,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miriam improved rapidly after I posted my letter of Christmas day. Rest,
      quiet, and nourishment were what she needed&mdash;and those she had. The
      doctors gave us permission to leave Havre yesterday; and we arrived here
      in the afternoon. She is pale and weak, and wasted to the merest shadow of
      herself, having lost <i>twenty-six pounds</i> in weight. But she does not
      suffer any more bodily pain; though what her agony of mind must be it is
      not difficult for those who love her to imagine. However, that will soon
      be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I telegraphed in advance to Dr. Désessaires, requesting him to call upon
      us here at our hotel last evening. He came at eight o'clock, and put
      Miriam through a thorough examination. He confirmed what all the other
      doctors had said&mdash;that it was a paralysis of the optic nerve. He
      enquired all about her health in the past, and particularly whether she
      had ever had any trouble of the brain or spine. Then, of course, we told
      him of that accident which she met with in 1884, which had deprived her of
      her memory, 'Ah! said he, 'that gives me the key to the whole difficulty.'
      He proceeded very carefully to examine her head, and when he had finished
      he said there was a depression of the bone at the point where she had been
      hurt at that time, and a consequent pressure upon the brain; and it was
      that pressure upon the brain which accounted for the extraordinary
      violence of her sea-sickness and the resultant blindness. Finally, he said
      that an operation to relieve that pressure would, if made at once, restore
      her sight; but that, unless such an operation was performed, she must
      remain permanently blind. He assured me that the operation was not a
      dangerous one; that it would consist in the removal of a minute fragment
      of the bone&mdash;what is called trephining. Of course, there was nothing
      for us to do but consent to having the operation performed; and thereupon
      he went away, saying he would return this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eleven o'clock this morning he arrived, accompanied by four other
      physicians&mdash;Dr. Cidolt, also an oculist; Dr. Gouet, the famous
      alienist; Dr. Marsac, a general practitioner of very high standing; and
      Dr. Larquot, said to be the most skilful surgeon in France. They made a
      long examination, and then withdrew to consult together. At the end of
      nearly two hours they came to me with their report, which was simply a
      repetition of what Dr. Dêsessaires had already said&mdash;that trephining
      would be necessary, that it would be effective, and that it would be as
      free from danger as such an operation ever is. It must be performed as
      soon as possible, so that atrophy of the optic nerve may not have time to
      set in; but before they can safely undertake it, Miriam must be perfectly
      recovered in general health. They have set upon this day fortnight&mdash;the
      14th&mdash;as probably a favourable time. Meanwhile she is under the care
      of Dr. Marsac. Dr. Larquot is to conduct the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brave little woman! She supports her calamity so patiently! And she
      looks forward to that dreadful ordeal with an amount of nerve and courage
      that a man might be proud of. God grant that all may go well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing more for me to write at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always Yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry Fairchild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the close of Fairchild's letter this postscript was added, in a hand
      that we recognised as Miriam's, though it was cramped and irregular, as if
      she had written with her eyes shut:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Ones,&mdash;I cannot see to write to you; but I love you and love
      you, with all my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miriam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When my sister Josephine read that, she burst out crying like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited till she had dried her tears, Then, &ldquo;Well, my dear sister,&rdquo; I
      questioned, &ldquo;do you realise what that letter means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What it means? Why, that her blindness is only temporary, and can be
      cured. That she will recover her sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else! This else&mdash;and I am surprised that you do not see it for
      yourself&mdash;it means that the same operation which will restore her
      sight will also restore her memory. Do you understand? She will become
      Louise Massarte again. She will begin at the precise point where Louise
      Massarte left off. She will forget everything that has occurred during the
      past four years, and will recall what occurred before. It is that same
      pressure of the bone upon the brain to which they rightly or wrongly
      attribute her blindness&mdash;it is that same pressure of the bone upon
      the brain which keeps Louise Massarte in quiescence, and makes Miriam
      Benary possible. Relieve that pressure, remove that point of bone, and
      instantly Louise Massarte will spring into life again, while at the same
      moment Miriam Benary will cease to exist. That is what Fairchild's letter
      means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; gasped Josephine, holding up her hands in helpless dismay.
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but surely&mdash;&mdash; but what&mdash;what is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, in your opinion, would be the lesser of the two evils&mdash;to
      have her remain permanently blind, or to have her regain her memory? She
      would recollect all that she is happiest in forgetting, she would forget
      all that she is happiest in remembering. The four years during which she
      has lived here with us as our niece would be utterly obliterated and
      undone. She would rise from that operation in mind and spirit exactly
      where she was, and exactly what she was, just before you and I put her
      under the influence of ether on the 14th day of June, 1884. Which, I want
      you to tell me&mdash;which would be the lesser evil: the blindness of
      Miriam Benary, or the resurrection of Louise Massarte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is no room for question about that. Better a thousand times
      that she should never see the light of day again, than that she should
      cease to be herself, and return to her dead personality. Why, it is&mdash;it
      is Miriam's very life, her very existence, which is at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. It is, so far as she is concerned, a choice between blindness
      and death. Nay, something worse than death: a hideous transformation of
      her identity, from that of a pure and innocent young bride, to that of a
      weary, heart-sick, sinful woman-convict. To cure her blindness by the
      means which they propose, would simply be to kill her; to abolish Miriam
      Benary and to substitute for her Louise Massarte. It is infinitely better
      that she should remain blind. Therefore, I am going to prevent that
      operation if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can indeed! But how can you? They are three thousand miles away.
      How can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us see. To-day&mdash;to-day is the 12th, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to-day is Saturday the 12th. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the day set for the operation is the 14th&mdash;that is, the day
      after to-morrow, Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall go at once and cable to Fairchild, imploring him,
      commanding him, no matter at what cost, to postpone the operation until I
      arrive in Paris. Then I shall engage passage aboard the first swift
      steamer that sails. The South German Clyde steamers sail on Mondays. They
      make the passage in seven days, and touch at Cherbourg. Do you, meanwhile,
      prepare my things, so that I may take ship day after tomorrow. Once
      arrived in Paris, I will persuade Fairchild to relinquish the idea of the
      operation for good and all. I will convince him that Miriam's life will be
      imperilled. Or, failing in that, I may find myself compelled to tell him
      the truth about Louise Massarte. Anything will be better than to have her
      regain her memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, anything. God grant that he may not disobey your telegram. But you
      must engage passage for me as well as for yourself. I cannot stay at home
      here idle. You must let me go with you. I should die of anxiety alone here
      at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went to the nearest telegraph office, and sent the following cable
      despatch:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairchild, Hôtel Bourdonnaye, Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all costs postpone operation till I arrive. Miriam's life endangered.
      Sail Monday, viâ Cherbourg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I hastened to the steamship company's office in Bowling Slip, and
      engaged staterooms for my sister and myself aboard the <i>Egmont</i> which
      was to sail promptly at noon on Monday the 14th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, despite these precautionary measures, a heavy load of anxiety lay
      upon my heart. What if Fairchild should suffer the operation to proceed,
      notwithstanding my protest? I could not banish that contingency from my
      mind, nor its ghastly <i>corollaries</i> from my imagination.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hough by no means
      so stormy as that described by Fairchild, our voyage was an unconscionably
      long one. To say nothing of fogs and head winds, an accident befell our
      machinery, whereby we were compelled to lie to for sixteen precious hours,
      while the damage was repaired. We did not make Cherbourg till the
      afternoon of Friday, January 25.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashore, my first act was to enquire when a train would leave for Paris. A
      train would leave at midnight, due at the capital at half past nine in the
      morning. My next act was to telegraph Fairchild, informing him of our
      arrival, and warning him to expect us on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half past nine to the minute, Saturday, we drew into the Gare St.
      Lazare. We were a little surprised not to find Fairchild there to meet us,
      and perhaps also a little disturbed. Was Miriam so ill that he dared not
      leave her? After seeing our luggage through the Customs House, we got into
      a cab, and were driven to the Hôtel de la Bourdonnaye.
    </p>
    <p>
      I inquired for Mr. Fairchild.

      &ldquo;Monsieur Fairchild is in his room, Monsieur.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Show us thither at once,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, Monsieur. If Monsieur will have the goodness to send up his card&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josephine,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;how do you account for this? Apparently we are
      not expected. He does not meet us at the railway station; and here at his
      hotel we are required to send up our card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, send it up. We shall soon have an explanation,&rdquo; Josephine said; and
      I acted upon her advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two minutes Fairchild appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Arrived!&rdquo; he cried, seizing each of us by a band. &ldquo;Your steamer was
      overdue; when did you get in? Why didn't you telegraph from Cherbourg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why <i>didn't</i> I telegraph? But I did. Do you mean to say you haven't
      received my despatch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the ghost of one. If I'd known you were coming this morning&mdash;&mdash;
      But wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into the office of the hotel. Issuing thence in a moment,
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he cried, exhibiting a blue envelope, &ldquo;here's your telegram. In
      America I should have received it twelve hours ago. But they manage these
      things better in France. It came last night, after I'd gone to bed and the
      authorities of this hostelery were too considerate to wake me. Then this
      morning, they say, they thought I was so much occupied that, they would do
      best to wait about delivering it till I was at leisure. That's French
      courtesy with a vengeance. However, you're safely arrived at last, and
      that's the important thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Miriam? Miriam?&rdquo; I demanded impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctors are with her even now,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got my cable despatch, of course, and put off the operation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I got your despatch; and we put off the operation until all the
      physicians insisted that it must not be put off longer&mdash;that, if put
      off longer, it would be ineffective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panic-stricken, &ldquo;You don't mean to say,&rdquo; I gasped, &ldquo;you can't mean to say
      that it has been performed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I just told you, they're with her now. They are performing it at this
      moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens and earth, man! Didn't I say in my telegram that it would imperil
      her life? Didn't I entreat you at all costs to postpone it until I
      arrived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did, certainly. But these other medical men, who were on the spot,
      and could examine her for themselves, were of one mind in declaring that
      her life would not be imperilled, but that the longer the operation was
      delayed, the greater would be the danger of atrophy of the optic nerve.
      Finally, on Wednesday of this week, they fixed upon this morning as the
      furthest date to which they could consent to postpone it. It was a choice
      between going on without your presence, and taking the risk of permanent
      blindness. So I had to let them proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you have done! You have done that which you will
      repent to your dying day!!&rdquo; I groaned, wringing my hands. &ldquo;You might have
      known that I never should have telegraphed as I did&mdash;that I never
      should have packed up and taken ship for Europe at two days notice&mdash;unless
      it was a matter of life and death But where are they? Take me to them.
      Perhaps it is not yet too late. Perhaps I am still in time to prevent it.
      Take me to them at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt whether they will admit you. They would not allow me to be
      present, and I am her husband. I have had to walk up and down the
      corridor, waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not admit me! They will admit me, if have to break down the door. Take me
      to them this instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;This way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led me up a flight of stairs, and halted before a door, upon which he
      gently rapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was immediately opened by an elderly man, in professional
      broad-cloth, who said in French: &ldquo;You may enter now. It is finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart turned to ice. For a breathing-space I could neither move nor
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, with the stolidity that is born of despair, &ldquo;Finished!&rdquo; I
      repeated. &ldquo;You have then trephined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the patient&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not yet recovered from the anaesthetic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We entered the room. Miriam, pale and beautiful, lay unconscious upon a
      sofa near the windows. Two other professional-looking gentlemen stood over
      her, one of whom was fanning her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairchild presented me: &ldquo;The English physician, Dr. Benary, the uncle of
      my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was in no mood to be courteous or ceremonious. Having bowed, &ldquo;Gentlemen,
      I must beg you to leave me alone with the patient,&rdquo; I began, addressing
      the company at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      My remark created a sensation. The French physicians exchanged perplexed
      and astonished glances; and a chorus of indignant &ldquo;Mais, monsieurs,&rdquo; rose
      about my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairchild, I am in earnest,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I insist upon these gentlemen
      leaving me alone with my niece. I look to you to see that they do so. I
      have neither the leisure nor the inclination to discuss the matter. Every
      second is precious.&rdquo; Somehow or other Fairchild prevailed upon them to
      withdraw. I suspect they saw that I was in no frame of mind to bear
      trifling with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may remain?&rdquo; Fairchild queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not even you. I must be quite alone with her for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, do not waste time is controversy. Leave me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fairchild reluctantly went off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down at the side of Miriam's couch, and fanned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by she opened her eyes, and they rested upon my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      From their expression, it was obvious that she saw me. Her blindness had
      been cured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at once, however, she closed her eyes again; and then for a little
      while she lay still, like one half asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she drew a deep quick breath, sat up, and looking me intently in
      the face, &ldquo;Well, is it over?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear; it is over,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Well, then, it is a failure&mdash;a
      total, abject failure! I remember everything. My memory was never clearer
      or more circumstantial. And you&mdash;you said there was no chance of
      failure! Oh, I was a fool to believe you. But what were you, to tell me
      such monstrous lies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, she sighed, and fell back upon her pillow, while I, with
      a deadly sickness at the heart, realised that the worst which I had feared
      had come to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was Louise Massarte now. Where was Miriam Benary? She was Louise
      Massarte. She had taken up her former life at the exact point where Louise
      Massarte had dropped it. She had begun anew at the exact point where
      Louise Massarte had left off. And the operation which she had in her mind
      when she asked, &ldquo;Is it over?&rdquo; was the operation which I had performed upon
      her nearly five years before. Those intervening years were as perfectly
      erased from her consciousness as if they had been passed in dreamless
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was Miriam Benary? What had become of that sweet and winning
      personality? And of the innocent pure love with which she had blessed our
      lives? Oh, it was a hideous transformation. Miriam was gone into the
      infinite void of Nothingness, leaving this changeling in her place. It was
      more unbelievable, it was more horribly impossible, than any wild
      nightmare phantasy, than any ancient grisly tale of necromancy; and yet it
      was true, it was undeniable, it was irremediable. It was worse,
      incomparably worse, than it would have been if she had died. For had she
      died, we could at least have hoped that her soul still lived, good and
      true and beautiful as ever. But now her soul had simply changed its form,
      and become the corrupt and sinful essence of Louise Massarte&mdash;just as
      in books of the Black Art we read of the fair virgin Princess being
      changed at a touch into a wicked grinning ape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have failed, you have failed,&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, all at once, starting up, and speaking passionately: &ldquo;Oh, why did
      you interfere with me last night? Why did you cross my path and thwart my
      will? Why did you not let me die then, when it would have been so easy?
      Why did you bring me here to your house, to fill me and intoxicate me with
      hopes that were doomed to be disappointed? Oh, it was cruel, it was cruel
      of you. I was insane to listen to you. I was mad to place any sort of
      credence in what you said. It was so obvious a fairy-tale. I ought to have
      known that you promised the impossible, that you were either a liar or a
      lunatic.&mdash;But it is not yet too late. Leave me. Leave the room. Let
      me get up and dress myself, and go away. Where is your sister? She put
      away my clothes. Send her to me. I will not be detained here longer. Give
      me my clothes. I will get up, and go away, and throw myself into the
      river, before they have a chance to retake me, and send me back to
      prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could I do? What could I say? &ldquo;Oh, Miriam, Miriam,&rdquo; I faltered
      helplessly. &ldquo;Calm yourself. For Heaven's sake, lie quiet. You will work
      yourself into a fever, into delirium. Your agitation may cost you your
      life. Lie quiet and let me think. My poor wits are distracted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught at the name Miriam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miriam? Miriam! Who is Miriam? Have I not told you my name? My name is
      Louise Massarte. Why do you call me by another? Miriam!&mdash;Miriam! Am I
      in a madhouse? <i>Oh, oh! my head!</i>&rdquo; she screamed sharply, putting her
      hand to her head. &ldquo;What have you done to my head? What have you done to
      me? Oh, I had such a pain! It shot through my head. Oh! fool, imbecile,
      that I was, ever to enter your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture the door opened, and Fair-child came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could wait outside no longer,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I heard her scream. I
      cannot stay away from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my unspeakable amazement, she, at the sight of her husband (whom, I had
      every reason to suppose, she would not recognise), started violently, and,
      catching her breath, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You! Henry Fairchild! Henry Fairchild! Here! Good God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear Miriam,&rdquo; Fairchild answered, coming forward, and putting out
      his hand to take hold of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she drew quickly away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miriam again! Miriam! What farce is this? Am I really in a mad-house? Or
      have I gone mad? I believe you are both maniacs, that you call me Miriam.
      Or is it some charade that you are acting for my bewilderment? And you,
      Henry Fairchild! What are you doing here? You, of all men! Oh! this is
      some frightful trick that has been played upon me! This glib-tongued old
      man, with his innocent face and his protestations of benevolence, has
      trapped me here to send me back across the river. But why so much ceremony
      about it. Call your officers at once, and give me up to them. One thing
      I'll promise you: they'll never get me back there alive. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
      And so, Mr. Fairchild, your friend, Roger Beecham, is dead. I came to town
      last night for the especial purpose of calling upon him, and settling our
      accounts; and then I learned that he had died from natural causes. Well,
      there is one consolation: unless the dogma of hell be a pure invention, he
      is roasting there now. I daresay I shall join him there presently, and
      then we will roast together! What a blow his death must have been to you,
      his faithful Achates!&rdquo; During the first part of her speech, it was plain
      that poor Fairchild simply fancied her to be raving in delirium; but when
      she mentioned that name, Roger Beecham, an expression of terrified
      amazement, mingled with blank incomprehension, fell upon his face, and he
      stood staring at her, with knitted brows and parted lips, like a man
      dumbfoundered and aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope he died hard!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I hope his mortal agony was
      excruciating and long-drawn out. I hope his death-bed was haunted and
      surrounded by twenty thousand hateful memories!&rdquo; Fairchild found his
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roger Beecham,&rdquo; he repeated, as if dazed. &ldquo;What do you know of Roger
      Beecham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good! That's exquisite!&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;What do I know of Roger
      Beecham? You play your comedy very well, though I confess I don't see the
      point of it. What does Louise Massarte know of Roger Beecham? What does
      she <i>not</i> know of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fairchild became rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise Massarte!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;What have you to do with Louise Massarte?&mdash;the
      murderess of Beecham's wife! Was she&mdash;for God's sake, was she related
      to you? Long ago I noticed a certain resemblance&mdash;a certain remote
      resemblance&mdash;such a resemblance as might exist between an angel and a
      devil. But why do you speak to me of her? What can you know of her? Louise
      Massarte!&mdash;&mdash; Dr. Benary, what has happened to my wife? She is
      delirious. Yet how comes she to know these names? What can be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not delirious, Mr. Fairchild,&rdquo; she put in, hastily. &ldquo;But either you
      are, or you are a most clever actor, and have missed your vocation in
      failing to go upon the stage. As I said before, I cannot see the point of
      your mummery; but you do it uncommonly well. Why do you pretend not to
      recognise me? Surely, I can't have changed beyond recognition in two
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not recognise you? Not recognise you, Miriam, my wife! Oh, what dreadful
      insanity has come upon her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Miriam? Your wife?&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;Come, Mr. Fairchild, a truce to this
      mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fairchild sank upon a chair, and pressed his brow between his hands. &ldquo;She
      is out of her senses. But how comes she to know those names?&rdquo; he said, as
      if speaking to himself. Then, turning to me: &ldquo;Perhaps you, Dr. Benary, can
      clear this puzzle up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is hardly a fitting time or place for attempting to,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;If
      you had only respected my desires, there would have been no such
      occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you answer me this one question? Do you understand what she means by
      her reference to Louise Massarte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain that meaning to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, Fairchild. Not now. Later I will tell you everything. I have not
      the heart nor the wit to explain anything just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the relation, the connection, between that woman and my wife? Were
      they sisters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairchild, I implore you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began, but I got no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the couch upon which Miriam lay came a low peal of sarcastic
      laughter. Then suddenly it expired in a most piteous moan. She gave a
      sharp cry, and swooned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairchild was at her side in a twinkling. He knelt there, seizing her
      hands, and gazing with wild eyes into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is dead! She is dead!&rdquo; he groaned frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she has only fainted, from pain and exhaustion. But the consequences
      of a fainting fit in her condition may be terrible,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my darling! my darling!&rdquo; he sobbed, bending over till his cheek swept
      her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She never regained consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not the heart to dwell upon what followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paragraph, cut from <i>Galignant's Messenger</i> of February 1, tells
      its own story:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fairchild.&mdash;On Wednesday morning, January 30, at the Hôtel de la
      Bourdonnaye, of </i>phrenitis<i>, Miriam Benary, wife of Henry Fairchild,
      of Adironda.</i>&rdquo;

agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
